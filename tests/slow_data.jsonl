{"text": "CANTERBURY/ UK: A protein that may critically contribute to severe forms of Covid-19 has recently been identified by the University of Kent's School of Biosciences and the Institute of Medical Virology at Goethe-University. The study titled 'A potential role of the CD47-SIRPalpha axis in Covid-19 pathogenesis' has been published by the scientific journal Current Issues in Molecular Biology. SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. While many individuals develop only mild or no symptoms upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, others develop severe, life-threatening diseases. Researchers have found that the infection of cells with SARS-CoV-2 results in increased levels of a protein called CD47 on the cell surface. CD47 is a so-called \"do not eat me\" signal to the immune system's defences that protect cells from being destroyed. Virus-induced CD47 on the surface of infected cells is likely to protect them from immune system recognition, enabling the production of larger amounts of virus, resulting in more severe disease. Well-known risk factors for severe Covid-19 such as older age and diabetes are associated with higher CD47 levels. High CD47 levels also contribute to high blood pressure, which is a large risk factor for Covid-19 complications such as heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease. The data suggest that age and virus-induced high CD47 levels contribute to severe Covid-19 by preventing an effective immune response and increasing disease-associated tissue and organ damage. Since therapeutics targeting CD47 are in development, this discovery may result in improved Covid-19 therapies. Professor Martin Michaelis, University of Kent, said, \"This is exciting. We may have identified a major factor associated with severe Covid-19. This is a huge step in combatting the disease and we can now look forward to further progress in the design of therapeutics.\" Professor Jindrich Cinatl, Goethe-University Frankfurt, said, \"These additional insights into the disease processes underlying Covid-19 may help us to design better therapies, as well as an appreciation for the importance of the breadth of research being conducted. Through this avenue, we have achieved a major breakthrough and exemplified that the fight against the disease continues.\""}

{"text": "England and Bangladesh cricketers after the match. (Reuters Photo)If you look at two of the most in-form teams in the ICC T20 World Cup, you will struggle to get past Pakistan and England. And you can reason why. Both teams are blessed with an attack which has variety, batsmen who can bat in the top six and can bowl a couple of effective overs of spin and take wickets, and power hitters. England brought all those aspects into play in their second Group 1 encounter at the Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday as they crushed a limp Bangladesh by eight wickets and 35 balls to spare to register their second win in the group. SCORECARDMoeen Ali, whose white ball bowling was utilized well by MS Dhoni during his IPL stint with Chennai Super Kings, has flourished in England colours too. After impressing with 2 for 17 vs West Indies, where he bowled his full quota of overs, the off-spinner had another productive outing with 2 for 18 in three overs, bowling 10 dots. Eoin Morgan is not a brave captain for nothing. Many would have taken Moeen off after he conceded two boundaries to Litton Das in the first over, which went for 10 runs after Bangladesh skipper Mahmudullah bucked the trend in the tournament and chose to bat. Not Morgan. He gave Moeen another over in the powerplay and the all-rounder responded with two wickets off two balls in the third over, dismissing both openers Das and Mohammad Naim. The in-form Mushfiqur Rahim and the talismanic Shakib-Al Hasan have the pedigree to rescue their team from the stickiest of situations, but England seamers have embraced the tactic of hitting the pitch, rather than floating balls up to the batters. In Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan and the talented Tymal Mills, they have three bowlers who can do that with expertise which can be rewarding on dry, powdery surfaces. Woakes, a master of hitting hard lengths, banged one in to Shakib which the Bangladesh star only managed to lob to short fine-leg and Adil Rashid grabbed the offering and surprised everyone, including himself, with his agility. Mahmuddulah and Mushfiqur looked set to do a decent repair job, but England are blessed with cricketers who have sublime skills. Liam Livingstone is one of them. Known more for his long-range striking, he also can bowl wrist spin to the right-handers and off-spin to the lefties. He dismissed an over-adventurous Mushfiqur lbw as the batsman attempted a reverse sweep and then got Mahmudullah to derail Bangladesh's innings. Mills, a late addition to England's line-up, showed his utility. Playing international cricket again after four years because of stress fractures of the back, the Sussex left-arm quick can bowl at 150 clicks and 105 without changing his action too much and that is a rare gift. He used those qualities to pick up 3-27 and end another impressive outing. In the death overs (15-20), Mills has an outstanding economy rate of 7.50. Among pacers with a minimum of 100 overs, it is the best. A target of 125 was never going to test the powerhouse batting line-up of England.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}

{"text": "GUWAHATI: Militants of the banned People's Liberation Army (PLA) and Manipur Naga People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Front (MNPF) on Saturday jointly carried out the deadliest ambush in the northeast in six years, killing an Army Colonel officiating as the commanding officer of 46 Assam Rifles, his wife and their six-year-old son along with four personnel of the paramilitary force near the India-Myanmar border in Churachandpur district. Col Viplav Tripathi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s convoy, comprising a quick-reaction team of the Assam Rifles, was passing by Sehken village in Singngat subdivision around 10.30am when an IED blast set them up for a volley of indiscriminate firing from the forested hillside that not only felled the Army officer from Chhattisgarh's Raigarh but also his wife Anuja and their son Abir. The four other Assam Rifles personnel killed in the ambush were identified as Suman Swargiari, Khatnei Konyak, RP Meena and Shyamal Das. Four personnel in the convoy were critically injured. \"The blast was targeted at the CO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vehicle and then the firing started. It was sudden and ferocious,\" a defence source said. PLA and MNPF issued a statement late in the evening claiming responsibility for the killings. The last such ambush on security forces in the militancy-ravaged region had also taken place in Manipur in 2015, when 18 soldiers were killed in Chandel district. Col Tripathi, on deputation from the Army's Kumaon Regiment, was returning along with his family to Churachandpur from a forward post at Behiang on the India-Myanmar border. He had attended a civic programme there on Friday. Behiang is about 120km from the state capital of Imphal. Churachandpur is the southern extension of the Manipur valley, with the ambush site having ample cover for the attackers to fire at the approaching convoy from camouflaged positions. The thinly populated area is mostly inhabited by the Zomi tribe. \"Strongly condemn the attack on the Assam Rifles convoy in Manipur. I pay homage to those soldiers and family members who have been martyred today. Their sacrifice will never be forgotten. My thoughts are with the bereaved families in this hour of sadness,\" PM Narendra Modi tweeted. Defence minister Rajnath Singh, too, took to Twitter to condemn the \"cowardly attack\" and term the deaths \"extremely painful & condemnable\". \"The nation has lost 5 brave soldiers including CO 46 AR and two family members. My condolences to the bereaved families. The perpetrators will be brought to justice soon,\" he wrote. Sources said Col Tripathi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s convoy was possibly targeted because he had recently intensified patrolling of the area, making it harder for militants based in neighbouring Myanmar to move to and from the state. Another theory is that Manipur outfits are rattled by the state government's plan to develop the Imphal-Behiang road that is the state's link with Southeast Asia in preparation for a second border trading point like Moreh. According to the Assam Rifles, Col Tripathi had a successful stint in Mizoram before he was transferred to Manipur about four months ago. A defence source said Army Chief Gen M M Naravane had been briefed about the attack and operations launched in the area to trace the attackers. A close watch is being kept on the Myanmar border to prevent them from escaping into that country. The Assam Rifles, a paramilitary force under the MHA, operates along the long porous India-Myanmar border in the hill ranges of Chandel, Ukhrul, and Churachandpur districts under the supervision of the inspector general (south), based in the Imphal headquarters. Manipur is due to go to the polls early next year. CM Biren Singh tweeted, \"Strongly condemn the cowardly attack on a convoy of 46 AR which has reportedly killed few personnel including the CO & his family at CCpur today. The state forces & paramilitary are already on their job to track down the militants. The perpetrators will be brought to justice.\"FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}
{"text": "Representative imageCANBERRA: Australia has reported its fewest daily Covid-19 cases in recent weeks as the country continues to battle the third wave of infections. There were 1,115 new locally-acquired cases and five deaths from the pandemic reported across Australia on Sunday morning. The majority of new cases were in Victoria, the country's second-most populous state with Melbourne as the capital city, where 905 cases and four deaths were reported. As of Saturday 90.4 percent of Australians aged 16 and over had received one Covid-19 vaccine dose and 83 percent were fully inoculated, according to the Department of Health. More than 250,000 Australians have had a third booster shot. As the booster rollout accelerates Health Minister Greg Hunt on Sunday said the government would not change its definition of \"fully vaccinated\". \"The advice at this stage of Professor Brendan Murphy's Scientific and Technical Advisory Group is that you're regarded as fully vaccinated with two doses,\" he told Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) television.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}
{"text": "Representative imageNEW DELHI: Greenpeace India on Sunday said the outcome of the international climate conference COP26 is not in line with the expectations of the people and the countries already facing extreme weather events but is not hopeless either. As imperfect as the final outcome may be, the goal of limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius may still be within reach, Avinash Chanchal, climate campaigner at Greenpeace India, told PTI. \"The outcome from COP26 in Glasgow is not in line with the expectations of the youth, the indigenous people and the countries that are already facing extreme weather events, however, it is not hopeless either,\" he said. Chanchal said definite plans and steps are needed to stop fossil fuel consumption along with support to the vulnerable and developing countries. \"We would have liked the 'phasing out' of all fossil fuel and not just coal, and weakening of this draft is not desirable. At the same time, this reflected the lack of trust among rich and poor countries as previous commitments were not met. At the current state, developing countries are far short of the funds needed for climate mitigation,\" he said. A compromise deal was accepted by 200 nations at the UNFCCC COP26 in Glasgow on Saturday, with several countries, including small island states, expressing disappointment by the change promoted by India to phase down, rather than phase out coal power, the single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. According to Jennifer Morgan, executive director at Greenpeace International, a signal has been sent that the era of coal is ending. \"It's meek, it's weak and the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal is only just alive, but a signal has been sent that the era of coal is ending. And that matters. \"Glasgow was meant to deliver on firmly closing the gap to 1.5 degrees Celsius and that didn't happen, but in 2022, nations will now have to come back with stronger targets. The only reason we got what we did is because young people, indigenous leaders, activists and countries on the climate frontline forced concessions that were grudgingly given,\" Morgan said. She further said that the line on phasing out unabated coal and fossil fuel subsidies is weak and compromised, but its very existence is nevertheless a breakthrough, and the focus on a just transition is essential. \"The call for emissions reductions of 45 per cent by the end of this decade is in line with what we need to do to stay under 1.5 degrees Celsius and brings the science firmly into this deal. But it needs to be implemented,\" Morgan said. Greenpeace India's Chanchal said this is the first time fossil fuels have been named and shamed in COP text, and now all countries need to ensure strict 2030 targets by the end of next year to reach the 1.5 degree goal. \"The next 10 years is going to be crucial and countries must ensure the pledges and commitment made in Glasgow get translated into action on ground. \"We have to be creative and bold in doing business and trade in a way that we prioritise 'planet over profit'. We cannot toy with our planet, there cannot be space for 'greenwashing scam' by the big polluting industries,\" Chanchal said. Greenpeace India said that the need to increase climate finance from the richest countries is urgent, and they must come up with stronger commitment to help rebuild the trust with the vulnerable and developing countries. \"As COP goes to Egypt next year, all the countries must come up with stricter plan to halve emission targets by 2030. We are already running out of time, and we must act to phase out from fossil fuels in a time-bound manner,\" Chanchal added.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}

{"text": "ZURICH: Major multilateral organisations will launch a new initiative next week aimed at developing a system of standards for companies, investors and financial institutions to measure their impact on global sustainability. The new Impact Management Platform is founded by organisations including four UN agencies, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Bank. Regulators and multilateral agencies are looking at ways to replace a patchwork of voluntary social and environmental disclosure rules, aiming to tackle \"greenwashing\" by organisations eager to present themselves as ethical. IOSCO, the global umbrella body for securities regulators, has helped set up the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), which was unveiled at the U.N.'s COP26 global climate summit in Scotland earlier this month. The founders of the Impact Management Platform said they aimed to go beyond a risks and returns model, in which organisations determine and disclose information that could affect near-term financial performance, and take a broader view of how their activities affect society and the planet. \"Increasingly, investors and other actors in the financial system and corporates are going to be expected to be able to have a better understanding of the impact they have on their customers and through their financing,\" Eric Usher, head of the U.N. Environment Programme's Finance Initiative, told Reuters. \"It includes looking at the whole process of how to improve impacts, (not just) disclosure,\" Romina Boarini, Director of the OECD's Centre on Well-being, Inclusion, Sustainability and Equal Opportunity, added."}
{"text": "Premier League chairman Gary Hoffman will step down at the end of January 2022, just 19 months after taking charge, the English top flight league announced on Wednesday. The confirmation of Hoffman's departure follows media reports that he was under pressure from clubs to step down in the wake of a Saudi Arabian-backed consortium's takeover of Newcastle United. \"It has been a privilege to lead the Premier League through the last two seasons - when the spirit of English football has been more important than ever,\" Hoffman said in a statement. \"Now, I have decided the time is right for me to stand aside to allow new leadership to steer the League through its next exciting phase.\" Hoffman, who was appointed in April last year and took over in June, was described as an \"outstanding candidate\" by Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck, but British media reported that he had lost the confidence of Premier League chairmen in recent weeks. A majority of clubs opposed the Premier League's decision to clear Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), chaired by the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to buy Newcastle last month. Eighteen of the league's 20 clubs also voted in favour of a temporary rule to stop teams from agreeing sponsorship deals with companies linked to their owners, in a move to restrict Newcastle's new owners. Hoffman's turbulent spell in charge also coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the failed breakaway attempt of the European Super League. The Premier League thanked Hoffman for his service \"during the most challenging period in its history\" and said the process for appointing a new chair would begin immediately.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}

{"text": "Fans take selfies before the first Twenty20 match between India and New Zealand at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur. (AFP Photo)JAIPUR: Covid-19 prevention guidelines were violated blatantly as a sizeable number of spectators and local police were seen without masks before the start of first T20I between India and New Zealand on Wednesday, the first international cricket match in the country since the second wave of the pandemic. No crowd restrictions were put in place for the series opener but spectators were allowed entry into the Sawai Mansingh Stadium with proof of vaccination or a negative RT-PCR test. Though the Rajasthan Cricket Association was expecting the game to be a sell-out, not more than half of the 25000 capacity stadium was filled half hour before the start of the match. The fans who made a beeline outside the stadium were excited about international cricket returning to the city after eight years but at least half of them did not care to wear a mask. Many policemen guarding the facility were also seen without a mask. \"I have come here with my son since I got a complimentary pass. The food items sold here are very expensive,\" said a local resident Anil Gupta inside the stadium. Asked whether his vaccination status was checked at the entry, he replied in the negative. He too did not wear a mask. A college student Mohit Shera too was roaming around without any facial protection. \"I am here as an international match is taking place after a long time. I play myself and it is exciting to be watching the game,\" said Mohit, who ran back to his seat when asked why he was not wearing a mask. It is for the first time amid the pandemic that crowd capacity has not been capped. The India-England Test series earlier this year were played with a 50 per cent stadium capacity before a spike in cases forced the BCCI to hold the ODIs behind closed doors.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}

{"text": "Rohit Sharma and Rahul Dravid. (PTI Photo)RANCHI: India will look to clinch the series albeit with a more impactful batting performance from the middle-order in the second T20 International against New Zealand here on Friday. For coach Rahul Dravid and skipper Rohit Sharma, there couldn't be a better start than a series win against an old nemesis, which help them hit the right chord at the beginning of their partnership. Read Also1st T20I: Suryakumar Yadav, Rohit Sharma star in India's five-wicket win over New ZealandSkipper Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav produced sublime knocks as India bungled towards end before recovering in time to fashion a five-wicket win over New Zealand in the opening T20 International ushering in a new era in Indian cricket.A superlative display by their top-order and controlled bowling at the back-end ensured a five-wicket victory against Black Caps, ending 'Men in Blue' seven-match losing streak across formats. For Rohit, before he gets a much-needed two and half week break from the game, he would like to close the deal at Ranchi and go for the jugular when the teams meet in Kolkata for the final game of the series. In absence of Virat Kohli, currently on leave, Suryakumar Yadav made full use of the opportunity at number three with a match-winning 62 off 42 balls. While there is absolutely no necessity to press the panic button, but Shreyas Iyer and Rishabh Pant's scratchy batting did slightly mess up the chase although it was never out of control. Read AlsoDidn't feel much difference as I play at No. 3 for MI but ready to be flexible for Team India: Suryakumar YadavSuryakumar Yadav felt at ease while batting at his preferred number three slot but knows very well that he will have to be flexible as per Indian team's needs in the coming days leading up to next T20 World Cup.Shreyas, who is playing a match for India after a long break, did look rusty as he found it difficult to middle the ball. He also didn't look too keen on farming the strike with singles and twos when big shots weren't coming off. Shreyas scored 5 off 8 balls before being dismissed in the penultimate over by Tim Southee, but thanks to India's healthy run-rate the chase did not go out of their hands. However silver-lining certainly was Suryakumar, whose precision hits delighted the capacity crowd at Sawai Man Singh Stadium. The other big positive was the performance of senior bowlers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Ravichandran Ashwin, who were brilliant in terms hitting the right areas while some of the inexperienced bowlers leaked runs at the other end. With his concern about his form, the new management under Rohit and Rahul gave veteran seamer Bhuvneshwar a lifeline after he was dropped due to indifferent form in their loss against Pakistan in the T20 World Cup. Read AlsoIndia vs New Zealand: It was not an easy win, says Rohit SharmaIndia captain Rohit Sharma on Wednesday admitted that the win against New Zealand in the first T20 International did not come easy in the end but said the players would learn from the experience.By his standards, Bhuvneshwar was going through the toughest phase in his career and had returned with just three wickets in six games at an average of 54 and economy rate of 7.04 for Sunrisers Hyderabad. But the 31-year-old delivered in style and exploited the swing on offer at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium before cleaning up Daryl Mitchell with a perfect inswinger to return with 2/24 which was second to Ashwin's 2/23 India were also brilliant at the death and conceded just 41 runs taking three wickets which denied the visitors a good 15-20 runs. \"At one stage, it was looking like 180-plus so a great effort from a complete bowling performance. A good game for us, especially when we're missing a few players, so it was an opportunity for the other guys to show their ability,\" Sharma said. The lower middle-order also may become a cause of concern for the skipper as it remains to be seen if he is tempted to tinker his batting line-up. Having already committed to giving his players a long rope, it is unlikely that Rohit will disturb the batting line-up just after one game. Although in bowling, there could be a forced change as Indian pacer Mohammad Siraj has suffered a split left webbing after being hit by Mitchell Santner in the final over of the New Zealand innings.

If losing the toss was crucial for the visitors under Tim Southee, Mark Chapman (50-ball 63)'s return after being on the sidelines for seven months would be a bright spot for Kiwis. Southee would look for course correction from the bowling line-up which would be keen to restrict the flow of runs especially in the Powerplay.

{"text": "\"China was, is, and will always be a good neighbour, good friend, and good partner of ASEAN,\" Chinese state media quoted Xi as saying.BEIJING: Chinese President Xi Jinping told leaders of the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at a summit on Monday that Beijing would not \"bully\" its smaller regional neighbours, amid rising tension over the South China Sea. Beijing's territorial claims over the sea clash with those of several Southeast Asian nations and have raised alarm from Washington to Tokyo. But Xi said China would never seek hegemony nor take advantage of its size to coerce smaller countries, and would work with ASEAN to eliminate \"interference\". \"China was, is, and will always be a good neighbour, good friend, and good partner of ASEAN,\" Chinese state media quoted Xi as saying. China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assertion of sovereignty over the South China Sea has set it against ASEAN members Vietnam and the Philippines, while Brunei, Taiwan and Malaysia also lay claim to parts. The Philippines on Thursday condemned the actions of three Chinese coast guard vessels that it said blocked and used water cannon on resupply boats headed towards a Philippine-occupied atoll in the sea. The United States on Friday called the Chinese actions \"dangerous, provocative, and unjustified,\" and warned that an armed attack on Philippine vessels would invoke US mutual defence commitments. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte told the summit hosted by Xi that he \"abhors\" the altercation and said the rule of law was the only way out of the dispute. He referred to a 2016 international arbitration ruling which found China's maritime claim to the sea had no legal basis. \"This does not speak well of the relations between our nations,\" said Duterte, who will leave office next year and has been criticised in the past for failing to condemn China's conduct in the disputed waters. ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Myanmar no showXi told the summit that China and ASEAN had \"cast off the gloom of the Cold War\" - when the region was wracked by superpower competition and conflicts such as the Vietnam War - and had jointly maintained regional stability. China frequently criticises the United States for \"Cold War thinking\" when Washington engages its regional allies to push back against Beijing's growing military and economic influence. US President Joe Biden joined ASEAN leaders for a virtual summit in October and pledged greater engagement with the region. The summit was held without a representative from Myanmar, Malaysia's Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said on Monday. The reason for the non-attendance was not immediately clear, and a spokesperson for Myanmar's military government did not answer calls seeking comment. ASEAN sidelined Myanmar junta leader Min Aung Hlaing, who has led a bloody crackdown on dissent since seizing power on Feb. 1, from virtual summits last month over his failure to make inroads in implementing an agreed peace plan, in an unprecedented exclusion for the bloc. Myanmar refused to send junior representation and blamed ASEAN for departing from its non-interference principle and caving to Western pressure. China lobbied for Min to attend the summit, according to diplomatic sources.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}

{"text": "Pakistan hockey players in Bhubaneswar. (ANI Photo)After failing to compete in the 2016 edition in Lucknow due to visa issues, Pakistan's junior team is looking to put on a good show at the Junior Hockey World Cup to be held in Bhubaneswar from November 24 to December 5. Although Pakistan had qualified for the 2016 event, diplomatic tensions between India and Pakistan - following the attacks in Uri and Pathankot - meant that the event went ahead without their participation. But bilateral ties have improved since then. Even if the two national cricket teams don't travel to each other's country, Pakistan's senior hockey team came down for the Men's World Cup held in Bhubaneswar in 2018 and everything went ahead smoothly. They had even participated in the Champions Trophy in 2014, which was also held in Bhubaneswar, but that ended on a sour note after two of the Pakistan players made lewd hand gestures towards the crowd following their victory over India in the semifinals. One can only hope that no such incidents occur this time around as Pakistan look to taste success in the sport which they once dominated. It is indeed quite shocking that the three-time Olympic champions have failed to qualify for the last two Olympics. But the Abdul Rana-led side are looking to put all the disappointments behind them and put up a performance to remember. Pakistan, who are placed in Group D along with Germany, Argentina and Egypt, arrived in Bhubaneswar on Saturday night and have so far played two practice games against Chile and Canada. \"The players are in good spirits and they are playing as one unit. We have had a number of camps and have prepared well over the past two years despite the pandemic situation. Hopefully we will be able to play against Germany in full spirit,\" said Rana during a virtual press conference on Monday. While the team was unable to play any international matches, they did play against the senior team and other departmental teams to prepare themselves for the World Cup.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}
{"text": "Taliban forces ride in a car during a Taliban military parade in KabulKABUL: Afghanistan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Taliban authorities on Sunday issued a new \u00e2\u0080\u009creligious guideline\u00e2\u0080\u009d that called on the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s television channels to stop showing dramas and soap operas featuring women actors. In the first such directive to Afghan media issued by the ministry for the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice, the Taliban also called on women television journalists to wear Islamic hijabs while presenting their reports. And the ministry asked the channels not to air films or programmes in which the Prophet Muhammad or other revered figures are shown. The ministry called for banning films or programmes that were against Islamic and Afghan values. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese are not rules but a religious guideline,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a spokesman for the ministry, Hakif Mohajir, said. The new directive was widely circulated late on Sunday on social media sites. Despite insisting they will rule more moderately this time around, the Taliban have already introduced rules for what women can wear at university, and beaten and harassed several Afghan journalists despite promising to uphold press freedoms. The Taliban\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guideline for TV networks comes after two decades of explosive growth for independent Afghan media under the Westernbacked governments that ruled the country until August 15, when the Islamists regained power. Dozens of television channels and radio stations were set up with Western assistance and private investment soon after the Taliban were toppled in 2001. During the past 20 years, Afghan TV channels offered a wide range of programmes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from an \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerican Idol\u00e2\u0080\u009d style singing competition to music videos, along with several Turkish and Indian soap operas. When the Islamists previously ruled from 1996 to 2001, there was no Afghan media to speak of, they banned TV, movies and most other forms of entertainment, deeming it immoral. People caught watching TV faced punishment, including having their set smashed. Ownership of a video player could lead to a public lashing. There was only one radio station, Voice of Sharia, that broadcast propaganda and Islamic programming.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}

In an interview to Android Authority, Keating said, \"The competitor (Qualcomm) likes to toss that around at Mediatek, but we have not had heating issues.\" The Taiwan-based Mediatek recently announced its flagship processor Dimensity 9000. It takes on Qualcomm's flagship series set to be announced next week and Samsung's top-end Exynos processors. The all-new Dimensity 9000 series is the first 4nm design processors. Asia's top chip maker company is also aiming to move beyond smartphones. Mediatek CEO Rick Tsai recently said that the company wants to work with Microsoft. It is aiming that Windows 11-based laptops run on Mediatek-based processors the same way as they run on Qualcomm chips. Microsoft's Surface Pro X runs on ARM-based Qualcomm processors. PC makers HP, Lenovo and Samsung too have Windows PCs running on Qualcomm processor. Mediatek's chips power Chromebooks that run on Google's ChromeOS.

{"text": "File photo: US, Taliban plan to hold talks next round of talks in Qatar.WASHINGTON: The United States will resume talks with the Taliban next week in Qatar, addressing among other issues the fight against terrorism and the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. The American delegation will be led by the US special representative for Afghanistan, Tom West, for the planned two weeks of discussions, State Department spokesman Ned Price said Tuesday. The two sides will discuss \"our vital national interests,\" which include counterterrorism operations against the Islamic State group and al-Qaida, humanitarian assistance, Afghanistan's devastated economy, and safe passage out of Afghanistan for US citizens and Afghans who worked for the United States during the 20 year war. West met two weeks ago in Pakistan with representatives of the hardline Islamist movement that seized power in August as US forces completed their withdrawal. A first session between the two sides was held October 9-10 in the Qatari capital Doha, where US diplomats overseeing relations with Afghanistan transferred after the Taliban takeover. West on Friday reiterated US conditions for the Taliban to receive US financial and diplomatic support: fight terrorism install an inclusive government, respect the rights of minorities, women and girls, and provide equal access to educations and employment. He said the United States would continue to have dialogue with the Taliban and for now provide only humanitarian aid. Amir Khan Muttaqi, foreign minister of the Taliban government, which is not recognized by the international community, called last week in an open letter to the US Congress for the release of Afghan assets frozen by the US.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}
{"text": "NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the bill to repeal the three controversial farm laws. The government has listed 'The Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021' in the legislative business to be taken up in Lok Sabha during the winter session of Parliament beginning November 29. The Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021 seeks to repeal the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance, Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that government will withdraw the three agriculture laws after it failed to convince a certain section of farmers. The central government's decision to withdraw the farm laws came almost a year after thousands of farmers marched to the national capital and launched a months-long agitation against the laws. The Prime Minister had also announced that the government will constitute a committee to work on a new framework for Minimum Support Price (MSP). Despite the climbdown by the government, farmer unions have said they will continue their agitation on other demands, including an MSP law and the dismissal of Union minister Ajay Mishra over violence in Lakhimpur Kheri.

The foreign secretary said India has been \"active\" and \"engaged\" with the international community on the situation in Afghanistan to make sure that its larger interests are protected. \"We are in touch with all the countries concerned on this issue and we will have to see how best to protect our interests, make the best of a difficult situation,\" the foreign secretary said. \"But I think, in many senses, we have been quite active and I would say, engaged on the international front to make sure that our larger interests are protected and we are not in any way vulnerable to the new strategic realities in this part of our region,\" he added. The interactive session was organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce. Shringla also mentioned the UN Security Council Resolution 2593 on Afghanistan and described it as a \"seminal one\". The foreign secretary also said that there was a need to provide humanitarian access to Afghanistan and that there should be no human rights abuses of women, children and minorities. \"The UN Security Council resolution 2593 which is even now a seminal resolution on Afghanistan because it lays the benchmarks of what the international community expects from Afghanistan and what are those requirements from the Taliban,\" he said, \"One is an inclusive negotiated political settlement, the second is that its territory should not be used against the detriment of any other, the third is that they should provide humanitarian access, the fourth is that there should be no human rights abuses on women, children and minorities,\" he added. Shringla said these are the basic benchmarks that the international community would like to hold the current dispensation of Afghanistan accountable on. \"And this is something that we have to wait and watch,\" he added. The foreign secretary also mentioned the regional dialogue that India hosted recently on the Afghan situation. India hosted a regional dialogue on Afghanistan on November 10 that was attended by NSAs of Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The participating countries vowed to work towards ensuring that Afghanistan does not become a safe haven for global terrorism and called for the formation of an \"open and truly inclusive\" government in Kabul with representation from all sections of Afghan society. A declaration released at the end of the Delhi Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan said Afghan territory should not be used for sheltering, training, planning or financing any terrorist acts.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}

{"text": "BALLIA: Launching a tirade against his own party's central leadership, BJP leader and former MLA Ram Iqbal Singh said the death of over 700 farmers could have been prevented had the Union government withdrawn the three contentious agriculture laws within 30 days of the farmers' agitation. Singh, an executive committee member of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, also called Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut \"manchali\" (crazy, mischievous ) for her remarks about the country's independence. \"Over 700 farmers would not have died if the three agricultural laws were withdrawn within 30 days of the farmers' agitation. This decision to repeal the laws is a sign of happiness on one hand and 'late latifi' (a late act) on the other,\" Singh told reporters in the Nagra area of the district here on Tuesday evening. He also asked the government to accept all the demands of the farmers. Singh demanded from the Centre compensation of at least Rs 50 lakh to the kin of each farmer who died in the protest and employment to a member of the family. \"In case the dependents of the deceased farmers are illiterate, the Centre should grant such families a monthly honorarium of Rs 20,000,\" he added. Further, the BJP leader said in case of a minor dependent, the government should bear his or her education expenses. If the dependent is a widow, a monthly pension of Rs 25,000 be given, Singh further said. He had in the past said farmers would not have taken to agitation had the Centre consulted them before enacting the agricultural laws. He had also urged the government to bring a law guaranteeing Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their produce. To a question on Kangana Ranaut, who is in the limelight over her controversial remarks, Singh called her a \"manchali\" (crazy, mischievous) woman. The government should invoke the National Security Act against her, he said. The Queen actor and Padma Shri recipient had kicked up a controversy saying India's independence in 1947 was \"bheek\" (alms) and that real independence was attained in 2014. More recently, the Youth Congress and the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee filed police complaints against her for allegedly making objectionable remarks against former prime minister Indira Gandhi and likening farmers to Khalistani terrorists.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}
{"text": "NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi and discussed the BSF's jurisdiction extension issue and demanded its withdrawal. \"I met Prime Minister Narendra Modi today over a number of state-related issues. We also spoke on the BSF's jurisdiction extension issue and demanded that this decision be withdrawn,\" Mamata said. Earlier, Mamata had opposed the Centre's decision to increase search and arrest jurisdiction of BSF in border states. In October, she said that the West Bengal government, like the Punjab government, is also protesting against the Centre's move.  She said law and order is a state subject and West Bengal's borders with Bangladesh were completely peaceful. The Trinamool Congress chief also spoke to PM Modi on Tripura violence. Mamata had described the situation in Tripura under the Biplab Deb-led BJP government as \"atrocious\" and asked why the human rights commission was \"not taking a note of the ongoing use of brute force\" in the Northeastern state. Speaking on the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, Mamata said that she is ready to help Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Singh if the need arises. \"If Akhilesh needs our help, then we are ready to extend help,\" she said. The West Bengal CM also invited PM Modi to inaugurate Global Business Meet. Meanwhile, Mamata said that she will meet Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray and NCP chief Sharad Pawar during her visit to Mumbai on 30th November-1st December. Mamata is slated to be in the national capital till November 25. Her visit comes days ahead of the winter session of Parliament which is scheduled to begin on November 29.

{"text": "A file photo of Republican lawmaker Nancy Mace. Five US lawmakers including Mace are on a surprise visit to Taiwan.TAIPEI: Five US lawmakers met with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen Friday morning in a surprise one-day visit intended to reaffirm the United States' \"rock solid\" support for the self-governing island. The bi-partisan group of lawmakers from the US House of Representatives arrived in Taiwan on Thursday night and were planning to meet with senior leaders including Tsai, said the American Institute in Taiwan, the de facto embassy. No further details were provided about their itinerary. The visit comes as tensions between Taiwan and China have risen to their highest level in decades. Taiwan has been self-ruled since the two sides split during a civil war in 1949, but China considers the island part of its own territory. \"When news of our trip broke yesterday, my office received a blunt message from the Chinese Embassy, telling me to call off the trip,\" Representative Elissa Slotkin, who is part of the delegation, wrote on Twitter. Representatives Mark Takano, Colin Allred, Sara Jacobs, and Nancy Mace are also part of the visiting delegation. \"We are here in Taiwan this week to remind our partners and allies, after two trying years that we've endured, that our commitment and shared responsibility for a free and secure Indo-Pacific region remain stronger than ever,\" said Takano. Takano added that the US relationship with Taiwan is \"rock solid and has remained steadfast as the ties between us have deepened.\" Tsai, who welcomed the lawmakers and the AIT director at the Presidential Office in Taipei, noted the two sides' cooperation in veterans' affairs, economic issues and trade while reiterating the island's close alignment with the US \"Taiwan will continue to step up cooperation with the United States in order to uphold our shared values of freedom and democracy and to ensure peace and stability in the region,\" Tsai said. The visit is the third by US lawmakers to Taiwan this year and comes just a few weeks after a group of six Republican members of Congress visited the island. That delegation met with President Tsai, National Security Secretary General Wellington Koo and Foreign Minister Joseph Wu, among others. In June, three members of Congress flew to Taiwan to donate badly needed vaccines at a time when the island was struggling to get enough. The Biden administration has also invited Taiwan to a Summit for Democracy next month, a move that drew a sharp rebuke from China. China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Wednesday, \"What the US did proves that the so-called democracy is just a pretext and tool for it to pursue geopolitical goals, suppress other countries, divide the world, serve its own interest and maintain its hegemony in the world.\"FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}

Buyers will also get a desktop best of Elon Musk, which also has been made from a molten metal of a Tesla. Caviar says that the design has been inspired from the outline of Teslas. The iPhone comes with engravings on the aluminium panel that features a portrait of Musk, an outline of an electric car and the Tesla logo. The phone also has some copper alloy, which as per Caviar, is a key component of electric car batteries. If you are wondering how much does the phone cost then it is priced at a whopping $5,600 (which is roughly Rs 4.19 lakh). Caviar will make only 99 copies of the limited-edition smartphone. As far as the desktop bust of Musk is concerned, it has been made of melted car parts like hood, doors. Caviar is making only 27 figurines and that will cost around $2,700 (Rs 2 lakh).

{"text": "People line up at a Covid-19 testing center in the courtyard of the Residenz, in Munich, Germany. (AP photo)FRANKFURT/BERLIN: For once, proverbially efficient Germany has dropped the ball. Seemingly endless queues all over the country for coronavirus booster shots and even for first vaccines are evidence that it has been caught out by a fourth wave of Covid-19, having led the world in its initial response to the pandemic early last year. Then, swift reporting and measures to limit contagion, helped by inspired political leadership, meant Germany suffered far fewer transmissions and deaths than Italy, Spain, France or Britain. But now it is among the worst affected nations in western Europe, hitting a record of over 76,000 infections on Friday and preparing to fly severely ill people around the country to find intensive care beds. Many academics and clinicians blame vaccine-hesitancy. While waning vaccine protection is compounding the emergency, about 32% of Germany's population have had no Covid-19 vaccine at all - among the highest rates in western Europe. In fact, the federal government ended funding for 430 vaccination centres at the end of September, when the flow of those seeking vaccination ebbed, passing the burden to family doctors and other medical practices. While in Britain more than 24% have had a booster shot after their initial course, in Germany the number is below 10%. With general practitioners now overwhelmed by demand, Thomas Mertens, chairman of the vaccination advisory panel STIKO, said last week - before the detection of a new highly contagious variant in South Africa - that most elderly people would be unlikely to get a booster before December or January. 'Confusion and frustration'Critics also point out that Germany has been in a political vacuum since a general election in September. Chancellor Angela Merkel, a former scientist who in early 2020 won praise for her swift decision to impose a lockdown and for a forceful televised appeal to reduce social contacts, has been leading a lame-duck administration while a new three-party coalition government is formed. Frank Roselieb, director of the Crisis Research Institute in Kiel, said a \"void\" in communication from Merkel, who had already announced her retirement and travelled abroad as intensive care units filled up, had led to widespread public complacency. \"Communication about the pandemic was left to subordinates and health experts who have less reach and impact than the chancellor,\" he said. To add to the disruption, health minister Jens Spahn this month told the 16 federal states to prioritise Moderna boosters that were nearing their expiry date over the more commonly used BioNTech/Pfizer shot. Spahn hailed Moderna as the \"Rolls-Royce\" of vaccines to overcome Germans' stubborn preference for the home-made BioNTech. But family doctors had to change their procedures, and Verena Bentele, president of the VdK social care association, said hesitant recipients were unlikely to be reassured by receiving a soon-to-expire vaccine: \"The management of the pandemic has been marked by unclear communication, which has led to confusion and frustration.\" Getting a grip on the crisis will now be the first priority for the incoming government led by the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) with the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats. Though not sworn in yet, the parties were criticised this month for failing to use their majority in parliament to stop the expiry of emergency laws that allow the federal government to order local lockdowns. Chancellor-in-waiting Olaf Scholz of the SPD has promised to speed up vaccinations and has declined to rule out making them compulsory.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}
{"text": "<p>US Representative Mark Takano being greeted by Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen at the Presidential Office in Taipei, Taiwan, on Friday. (AP)</p><p><br></p>TAIPEI: China's military carried out \"combat-readiness\" patrols in the direction of the Taiwan Strait on Friday as a US Congressional delegation made a surprise visit to Taipei, offering strong support to the Chinese-claimed, democratically governed island.  The five members of the US House of Representatives arrived in Taiwan on Thursday night for a previously unannounced two-day trip, second in a month.  As with the last visit, China's military announced the patrols in the vicinity of the narrow and sensitive Taiwan Strait that separates the island from its giant neighbour.  The People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theatre Command said that on Friday it \"organised naval and air forces to continue combat-readiness police patrols in the direction of the Taiwan Strait\".  \"The relevant actions are necessary to deal with the current situation in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan is part of China's territory, and defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity is our military's sacred mission.\"  It, however, gave no details.  Taiwan's defence ministry, as part of its daily update of Chinese air operations near the island, said that on Friday eight Chinese air force aircraft, including two nuclear-capable H-6 bombers, flew into Taiwan's air defence zone, though well away from mainland Taiwan and close to the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands at the top of the South China Sea. The Congressional visit China routinely denounces visits by US politicians to Taiwan, and its foreign ministry said it had made a formal complaint to Washington about the latest trip by the bipartisan congressional group, saying playing the Taiwan card was \"a losing hand\".  Meeting Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen at her office earlier on Friday, the leader of the US delegation praised the island as a \"force for good\" in the world.  \"Madame President, I want to commend and praise your leadership. Under your administration, the bonds between us are more positive and productive than they have been for decades,\" said Mark Takano, chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, whose group was previously in Japan and South Korea.  \"Our commitment to Taiwan is rock solid and has remained steadfast as the ties between us have deepened. Taiwan is a democratic success story, a reliable partner and a force for good in the world,\" he added.  The United States, like most countries, has no official ties with Taiwan but is the democratically ruled island's most important international backer and arms supplier.  Congresswoman Nancy Mace, who is part of the delegation, tweeted that China's Washington embassy \"demanded we cancel the trip\" when news of it broke.  \"We didn't,\" she added, and posted a picture of herself outside the US Air Force jet that carried her to Taipei under the caption, \"Just touched down in the Republic of Taiwan\", a term used by supporters of the island's formal independence.  China has stepped up military and political pressure on Taiwan to accept its sovereignty claims. Tsai has vowed to maintain peace with China, but that she will defend Taiwan if attacked.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}

{"text": "Pat Cummins. (Reuters Photo)MELBOURNE: Australia's newly-appointed Test captain Pat Cummins has revealed that he was asked to share any secrets he might have had before he was handed the leadership role by the selection panel. Cummins was made Australia's 47th Test captain ahead of the Ashes series after Tim Paine stepped down last week and took an indefinite break from cricket following the 'sexting scandal'. Read Also'Excellent cricketing brain'- Pat Cummins reaches pinnaclePat Cummins is widely regarded as an all-round nice guy with an excellent cricketing brain, doggedly overcoming early career injuries to reach the pinnacle of the game.While Cummins was chosen for the top job, former skipper Steve Smith was handed the vice-captaincy, three years after he was suspended for a year for his role in the ball-tampering scandal that rocked Australian cricket in 2018. Asked if the Cricket Australia panel had asked him \"anything like a confession\" before being appointed as captain, Cummins replied in an affirmative. \"Yeah, there were a couple of questions. I won't go into detail,\" Cummins told ABC sport during an interview but did not share the details. \"It was a really good open discussion. We talked about a lot of different things. So we both left it feeling really comfortable,\" said the 28-year-old Cummins. The five-person panel comprised selectors George Bailey and Tony Dodemaide, former Australia batter and current CA board member Mel Jones, CEO Nick Hockley and chair Richard Freudenstein. Australia had little time to prepare for the Ashes with the pace trio of Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc lacking in game time in red-ball cricket as they were busy with the ICC T20 World Cup. However, Australian bowling coach Andrew McDonald said he won't accept any excuse from his pace bowling unit as the opening Test begins on December 8. \"...It was always going to be a shortened prep, and less than ideal switching formats and quarantine and all that stuff,\" McDonald said during Australia's first practice session on Sunday. \"But I think the art of the modern-day cricketer is to be able to adapt to that. There'll be no excuses from our end and I'm sure there'll be no excuses from England's end either.\" The members of Australia's Ashes squad, who had participated at the T20 World Cup in UAE, are currently training at their quarantine centre in Gold Coast. \"We've had fantastic facilities up here. The weather has been challenging at times but we've still been able to get out into the centre. Also, these guys have got a lot of Test experience to draw upon,\" McDonald told news.com.au. \"So changing formats is something that they've been able to deal with across their careers. I think we'll be really, really, really well-prepared.\"Read Also'Excellent cricketing brain'- Pat Cummins reaches pinnaclePat Cummins is widely regarded as an all-round nice guy with an excellent cricketing brain, doggedly overcoming early career injuries to reach the pinnacle of the game.Read Also'Excellent cricketing brain'- Pat Cummins reaches pinnaclePat Cummins is widely regarded as an all-round nice guy with an excellent cricketing brain, doggedly overcoming early career injuries to reach the pinnacle of the game.Read Also'Excellent cricketing brain'- Pat Cummins reaches pinnaclePat Cummins is widely regarded as an all-round nice guy with an excellent cricketing brain, doggedly overcoming early career injuries to reach the pinnacle of the game.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}

{"text": "NEW DELHI: All international passengers, except those under five years of age, flying into India from Covid at-risk countries must undergo RT-PCR test on arrival, starting from 12.01am (IST) of December 1, 2021. This will include those transiting from these places too. Those testing negative must home quarantine for seven days and then re-test on the eighth day. Those who are testing positive will be admitted to seperate isolation facility and their sample sent for genomic testing and would be discharged if found not infected with the Omicron variant. Those found to be infected with this new variant will be kept in \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrict isolation\u00e2\u0080\u009d and treated till they test negative. Union health ministry on Sunday issued a new protocol for international arrivals in the wake of a new variant found in southern Africa, Hong Kong, and some other countries to prevent its spread here. This adds to the existing norms like a negative report from a RT-PCR test done within 72 hours of flying into India and filing a self-declaration form. They must also add details of their travel in the last 14 days from the time of arrival. To be sure, the government will keep updating the list of at-risk countries as the situation evolves. Five per cent of the passengers flying in from not-at-risk countries will also be tested on arrival on a random basis. \"The cost of testing of such passengers would be borne by the aviation ministry,\" the order says. Their samples will also be sent for genomic testing and they will be treated as per \u00e2\u0080\u009cstandard protocol\u00e2\u0080\u009d.

{"text": "Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal believes the US and India have buried many of their differences on the trade front as they look to forge a new relationship. Prior to his visit to Geneva for the WTO meet, now postponed due to the latest Covid variant, the minister said democracies are looking at new investment and trade options due to worries over \u00e2\u0080\u0098non-transparent economies\u00e2\u0080\u0099, without naming China. Excerpts:One of the issues on the WTO agenda is reforms and doing away with special and differential treatment (S&DT) for developing and poor countries. How do you see it?Any attempt to take away S&DT will fail. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to happen. The developed world cannot expect developing and less developed countries to come on a par with countries that have multiple times the per capita incomes of the less developed nations. These are areas on which we need a wide consensus building exercise to ensure that S&DT continues, to ensure that the consensus-based approach to negotiations continues, while there may be other areas of reforms on which we are open to discussions. The WTO will have to relook at some of the non-transparent practices that some countries indulge in and will have to address them. It will have to see that countries which are indulging in such practices are taken to task. Since Covid outbreak, there has been a lot of discussion on the need to create reliable and sustainable supply lines. How is that playing out?We have had very successful discussions with several countries, including the USTR (Katherine Tai) recently. EU is concerned about how to ensure supply chains remain open in the event of further emergencies. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a wake-up call and more and more democratic and developed countries are recognising that some economies are dangerous to work with as they can suddenly let you down. Resilient supply chains are probably one of the most critical areas of engagement. One non-transparent economy has been the villain and its entry into the WTO is often considered to be the biggest strategic blunder. How do you deal with that?While we cannot rewrite history, we will have to look at alternate and smarter ways of working among like-minded democratic countries and transparent economies, nations that believe in rule of law and fair play. They will have to build coalitions like the Resilient Supply Initiative between Japan, Australia and India. Look at the two QUADs that India is a part of (with the US, Australia, Japan and with the US, UAE and Israel). But such intent is not backed by initiatives. A recent poll of US companies showed 80% will look to invest more in China...I would not like to talk about what companies in other countries are doing but I will only say that nations across the world are very disturbed and anguished over the way the situation is emerging geo-politically and how it could have an adverse impact in their own countries. Such unfair trade practices ultimately take away jobs in countries that believe in a rule-based system. Just as India is taking steps to protect itself, many other countries are looking to protect themselves from indiscriminate investment or trade linkages with non-transparent economies. The India-US trade policy forum (TPF) is back after four years and by the looks of it you have made some progress. What are the key markers that you have set?The joint statement is so comprehensive, covering a vast range of subjects, that you will not find any other document, either with the US in the past or any other country. The message was clear that the US and India are natural partners and we can do a lot together. They are looking at India to be a much bigger trading partner and a much-bigger geo-strategic role for India. A lot of the historical baggage of several decades has been buried. There are some 40 issues from both sides\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Incidentally, we have also agreed that we should move away from this old school thinking about always trying to balance by moving on two issues each. We should look at each other as allies and see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the maximum each one can do. Both have differing sensitivities and we respect that. At the same time, we have differing economic prosperity levels. We are looking at more interactions so that misunderstandings don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t crop up.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}

Srinagar recorded a low of minus 1.5 degrees Celsius on Monday night -- down from minus 1.1 degrees Celsius the previous night, they said. Pahalgam, which serves as the base camp for the annual Amarnath yatra, recorded a low of minus 3.3 degrees Celsius, they said.

Qazigund, the gateway town to the valley, recorded a temperature of minus 1.4 degrees Celsius, while Kokernag recorded a low of minus 0.9 degrees Celsius. The meteorological department said the weather will most likely remain dry but cold till December 3. A weak western disturbance is likely to hit the region on the weekend, the officials said, adding precipitation will end the dry spell of weather in the valley. The wintry conditions in the valley set-in much ahead of the beginning of extreme harsh weather conditions which usually start around the third week of December.

{"text": "Nityanand RaiNEW DELHI: Union minister of state for home affairs Nityanand Rai on Tuesday said that till now, the government has not taken any decision to prepare the National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC) at the national level. His statement comes after Congres leader Hibi Eden in Lok Sabha questioned whether the government is considering the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the progress made in this regard. \"Till now, the Government has not taken any decision to prepare the National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC) at the national level,\" Rai said in a written reply to Lok Sabha. \"The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) was notified on 12 December 2019 and it came into force from 10 January 2020. The persons covered under the CAA may apply for citizenship after the rules are notified under the CAA,\" Rai added. When asked about the number of Indians who gave up Indian citizenship for the citizenship of another country, Rai informed that as per the information available with the Ministry of External Affairs, 1,33,049 people gave up Indian citizenship and took citizenship of other countries in 2017, 1,34,561 people did the same in 2018 followed by 1,44,017 in 2019, 85,248 people in 2020 and 1,11,287 people in 2021 as on September 30. The minister informed, \"A total number of 1,33,83,718 Indian nationals are living in foreign countries.\" Earlier this year in the monsoon session of the Parliament, Rai had said the Central Government has not taken any decision to prepare the National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC) at the national level.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}

He managed to call a colleague on the island to alert him, but was not found until nearly a full day later, the coastguard told AFP, when rescuers spotted him sitting on the engine of his capsized boat, clasping a propeller part. \"He was out in the sea alone for 22 hours. I am amazed by his survival skills,\" a coastguard official told AFP, declining to be identified. Dramatic footage released by the coastguard showed a team approaching him by boat calling out: \"We are coming! Just a little bit longer!

{"text": "BEIJING: The United States is at risk of paying an \"unbearable price\" due to its actions over Taiwan, Wang Yi, state councillor and foreign minister, said in an interview with state media on Thursday. China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and in the past two years has stepped up military and diplomatic pressure to assert its sovereignty claim, fuelling anger in Taipei and concern in Washington. By \"encouraging 'Taiwan independence' forces\" the United States \"not only puts Taiwan into an extremely dangerous situation but also exposes the United States to an unbearable price\", Wang said. Taiwan has emerged as a key factor in strained relations between China and the United States, the island's most important international backer and arms supplier despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties. Taiwan says it is an independent country and vows to defend its freedom and democracy. China regularly describes the island as the most sensitive issue in its ties with the United States. \"Taiwan has no other way forward other than reunification with the mainland,\" said Wang. While the United States recognises only one China, it is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself and has long followed a policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" on whether it would intervene militarily to protect Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}
{"text": "NEW DELHI: The home ministry on Friday extended the validity of Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) licences expiring between September 29, 2020 and March 31, 2022. This move comes as a relief for NGOs and associations that have applied for renewal of their registration under the Act but are still awaiting a decision. The extension has been given until March 31, 2022 or till the disposal of their application, whichever is earlier. The ministry, however, clarified that the FCRA licences of NGOs whose renewal plea has already been turned down, shall not be eligible for the extension. This essentially means that the Missionaries of Charity, an NGO founded by Mother Teresa, became ineligible for receiving any fresh foreign contributions or utilising foreign funds received by it, right from the day \u00e2\u0080\u0094 December 25, 2021 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the MHA rejected its FCRA renewal application due to \u00e2\u0080\u009cadverse inputs\u00e2\u0080\u009d. All NGOs are required to apply for renewal of their FCRA registration before expiry of the five-year validity of their respective licences, in accordance with Rule 12 of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Rules, 2011. While applying online for renewal, the NGOs are required to furnish the details of their FCRA account in SBI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s New Delhi branch and affidavits of office bearers furnishing details like their Aadhaar number, besides paying a Rs 5,000 renewal fee. This is the third time that the MHA has extended the validity of FCRA registration certificates of NGOs who had applied for their renewal after September 29, 2020. The original deadline of May 31, 2021 was extended to September 30, 2021. Thereafter, it was further extended to December 31, 2021. The home ministry on Friday made it clear that only those NGOs who had already applied for renewal of their FCRA licence expiring between September 29, 2020 and March 31, 2022, and were awaiting disposal of their application, would benefit from its decision to extend the validity of their FCRA registration.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}
{"text": "Military personnel regained control of the main airport, seized earlier by protesters.ALMATY: Fresh violence erupted in Kazakhstan's main city of Almaty on Thursday as Russia sent in paratroopers to put down a countrywide uprising in one of Moscow's closest former Soviet allies. Police in Almaty said they had killed dozens of rioters overnight into the early hours of Thursday morning. Authorities said at least 18 members of the security forces had died, including two found decapitated. More than 2,000 people were arrested. After a night of running street confrontations between protesters and troops, a presidential residence in the city and its mayor's office were both ablaze, and burnt out cars littered the city, Reuters journalists said. Military personnel regained control of the main airport, seized earlier by protesters. Thursday evening saw renewed battles in Almaty's main square, occupied alternately by troops and hundreds of protesters throughout much of the day. Reuters reporters heard explosions and gunfire as military vehicles and scores of soldiers advanced, although the shooting stopped again after nightfall. TASS news agency quoted witnesses as saying people had been killed and wounded in the new gunfire. The Russian deployment was a gamble by the Kremlin that rapid military force could secure its interests in the oil and uranium-producing Central Asian nation, by swiftly putting down the worst violence in Kazakhstan's 30 years of independence. Oil production at Kazakhstan's top field Tengiz was reduced on Thursday, its operator Chevron said, as some contractors disrupted train lines in support of the protests. Oil prices rose more than 1% on Thursday and uranium has also jumped since the clashes erupted. The internet was shut down across the country, disrupting bitcoin mining in one of the world's biggest crypto miners and making it impossible to gauge the extent of the unrest. But the violence was unprecedented in a state ruled firmly since Soviet times by leader Nursultan Nazarbayev, 81, who had held on to the reins despite stepping down three years ago as president. \"ATTACK ON OUR CITIZENS\"Nazarbayev's hand-picked successor, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, said he called in the Moscow-led military alliance of ex-Soviet states. He blamed the unrest on foreign-trained terrorists who he said had seized buildings and weapons. \"It is an attack on our citizens who are asking me... to help them urgently,\" he said. Moscow said it would consult with Kazakhstan and allies on steps to support the Kazakh \"counter-terrorist operation\" and repeated Tokayev's assertion that the uprising was foreign-inspired. Neither Kazakhstan nor Russia provided evidence to support that. Moscow did not disclose how many troops it was sending, and it was not possible to determine if any were involved in Thursday's unrest. The general secretary of the ex-Soviet alliance - the Collective Security Treaty Organisation - told RIA news agency that the overall peacekeeping force would number about 2,500 and could be strengthened if necessary. It was expected to be a short mission of \"a few days or weeks\", RIA quoted him as saying. The United States said it was closely monitoring reports of the deployment and added it had questions about whether the forces were legitimately invited to the country. \"We have questions about that deployment precisely because Kazakhstan, the government of Kazakhstan... has its own resources, and the government is and has been well fortified,\" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said. \"We will be watching very closely for any violations of human rights and any efforts or actions on the part of foreign forces to seize Kazakh institutions,\" he added. \"LOOTERS CAME IN\"The uprising, which began as protests against a New Year's Day fuel price hike, swelled on Wednesday, when protesters chanting slogans against Nazarbayev stormed and torched public buildings in Almaty and other cities. Tokayev initially responded by dismissing his cabinet, reversing the fuel price rise and distancing himself from his predecessor, including by taking over a powerful security post Nazarbayev had retained. But those moves failed to mollify crowds who accuse Nazarbayev's family and allies of amassing vast wealth while the nation of 19 million remained poor. Nazarbayev stepped aside from the presidency in 2019 as the last Soviet-era Communist Party boss still ruling a former Soviet state. But he and his family kept posts overseeing security forces and the political apparatus in Nur-Sultan, the purpose-built capital bearing his name. He has not been seen or heard from since the unrest began. The swift arrival of Russian troops demonstrated the Kremlin's willingness to safeguard its influence in the ex-Soviet Union with force. Since late 2020, Moscow has shored up the leader of Belarus against a popular uprising, intervened to halt a war between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and, to the West's alarm, massed troops again near Ukraine, which Russia invaded eight years ago. Deployment in Kazakhstan carries risk: by exposing the Kazakh authorities as dependent on Russian muscle, Moscow could further inflame the protesters. \"They are Kazakhs and Tokayev will try putting them down with Russian troops. That will not look great for Moscow,\" tweeted economist Tim Ash, who specialises in the region. But it is difficult to say how broad support might be for protests in a country with little organised opposition, especially if demonstrators are blamed for violence. \"Thank God, the military has arrived, finally,\" Ali, a manager at Holiday Inn hotel near Almaty's main square, told Reuters by phone. \"Looters came in last night, smashing car windows near us.\"FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}
{"text": "(Photo credit: Pro Kabaddi Twitter)BENGALURU: Tamil Thalaivas and Jaipur Pink Panthers played out an entertaining 31-31 draw in their Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) match here on Sunday. Defences of both the teams had a great outing with Thalaivas captain Surjeet Singh and Jaipur's Sandeep Dhull picking up High 5s. Thaliavas had a two-point lead going into the final raid of the match but made a mistake resulting in a tie. Their raider Manjeet misjudged a touch and walked into the lobby resulting in a Super Tackle and two points for Jaipur. In the other match, Patna Pirates' defence produced a performance to remember as it helped the team beat Bengaluru Bulls 38-31. Patna defenders Sunil (9 points) and Mohammadreza Shadloui (3 points) were instrumental in setting up a defensive wall that even the likes of Pawan Sehrawat could not break. Pawan, the current green sleeve holder (given to raider with most raiding points), scored a Super 10 in the first half but could not contribute even one point after the interval. A series of Super Tackles in the dying minutes ensured the Bulls lost the match with a margin of just seven points. The Bulls started the match brightly with Pawan Sehrawat looking his usual self. But Patna certainly had a plan to stop the champions of the sixth season. Their defenders pounced in group to shift their momentum to their side. Earlier, Tamil Thalaivas had the better start to the match with their defensive duo of Surjeet Singh and Sagar not giving Jaipur raider Arjun Deshwal an opportunity. The Panthers were not willing to let points leak in their defence as well with Sandeep Dhull and Sahul Kumar tackling the Tamil raiders with ease. The game changed momentum when experienced K Prapanjan suffering a shoulder injury during a raid in the seventh minute. Ajinkya Pawar was brought in as his replacement, but Jaipur sniffed an opportunity. Surjeet Singh produced a one-man Super Tackle on Arjun Deshwal but Jaipur clinched their ALL OUT eventually with two minutes to the interval. At halftime, the scores were 17-13 in favour of Jaipur. Tamil coach Uday Kumar wanted his team to make a slow comeback and not rush things, but his team had other plans. The second half started with a tackle on Jaipur's Deepak Hooda which was followed by a two-point raid by Bhavani Rajput. With three remaining on the mat, Thalaivas' Manjeet produced a stunning Super Raid that inflicted an ALL OUT. They took the lead, but the Panthers got it back immediately with Sandeep Dhull and Surjeet Singh picking their High 5s. The two teams matched tackle for tackle and the scores were level at 24-24 with 10 minutes remaining. Ajinkya Pawar got a two-point raid to open the lead for Thaliavas but Jaipur's Naveen produced a Super Tackle to close the gap. Jaipur, trailing by two points, produced a Super Tackle in the last raid of the match to earn a tie. Thalaivas will consider themselves unlucky as raider Manjeet walked into the lobby under the belief that he had gotten a touch. But the referees decided against his claim to end the closely-fought match.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}
{"text": "Keegan Petersen. (AFP Photo)PAARL (South Africa): South African batter Keegan Petersen has said that the Indian bowling attack was the most challenging he has ever come across in his cricket career so far. The right-hander was the top run-scorer in the three-match Test series, scoring 276 runs at an average of 46.00. He was the only player to score more than three half-centuries, recording scores of 72, 82, and 62. South Africa came from behind to win the Test series 2-1 and this may very well revive cricket in the country. \"It hasn't completely sunk in yet,\" he said. \"I still can't explain how it feels completely despite it being two days already. Myself, my family and everyone close to us are still trying to get over it somehow. It was a challenging series against one of the best bowling attacks in the world,\" the official website of Cricket South Africa (CSA) quoted Petersen as saying. \"It was by far the most challenging bowling I have come across in my career, whether it's been in first-class cricket or any form of cricket. It hasn't been an easy introduction for me to international cricket, but I honestly wouldn't have it any other way. My journey's unique and it's my story to tell as well,\" he added. The 28-year-old was named Player of the Series after his outstanding exploits with the bat against India. \"Whether I bat in the first couple of overs or whether I bat after 50 overs, I'm just grateful to have the opportunity to be there, playing amongst a group of guys who are also trying to start something new in South African cricket. We are also trying to tell a new story as a team together as well,\" said Petersen. \"Deano as our captain, he's going to, he has and he is going to achieve great things as well as a captain. He's a brilliant leader and we wouldn't want anyone else to lead us. The achievement for us as a squad, we know the chips were down and the odds were against us especially after the first game where we were beaten. It wasn't a good scenario, but we had a couple of strong chats after the game looking at ways to bounce back,\" he added. Further talking about the series win, Petersen said: \"It's just our personalities and character as South Africans, even though we're the underdogs, we always come back fighting. That's just how we are and we showed that during this series. Hopefully, it carries on for years to come,\" he added. South Africa and India will now lock horns in three-match ODI series, beginning Wednesday in Paarl.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}

{"text": "NEW DELHI: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday slashed India's economic growth forecast for financial year 2021-22 to 9 per cent on concerns over impact of new Covid variant. In the previous issue of its World Economic Outlook that was published in October 2021, IMF had estimated India's gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by 9.5 per cent for the current fiscal year. For the next fiscal year 2022-23, IMF projects Indian economy to grow at 7.1 per cent. IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath said that the slight downgrade is mainly due to the impact of the spread of the Omicron variant. \"If you look at the 2021-22 fiscal year, we have a slight downgrade of -0.5 percentage points and for the next fiscal year 2022-23 we have a slight upgrade of 0.5 percentage points. So, growth for the previous fiscal year is now nine per cent and for this year now is at nine per cent. We moved it up slightly,\" Gopinath told reporters during a news conference. According to the IMF, India's prospects for 2023 are marked up on expected improvements to credit growth and, subsequently, investment and consumption, building on better-than-anticipated performance of the financial sector. According to the first advanced estimates of GDP released few weeks back, the government projected India's GDP to grow by 9.2 per cent for FY22. Besides, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had projected 9.5 per cent GDP growth for the same period. Global growth is also expected to moderate from 5.9 per cent in 2021 to 4.4 per cent in 2022, half a percentage point lower for 2022 than in the October WEO, largely reflecting forecast markdowns in the two largest economies -- the US and China. The IMF slashed the growth forecast for the United States - world's largest economy - to 4 per cent from the 5.2 per cent it predicted in October. The Chinese economy is forecast to grow 4.8 per cent this year - down from 8.1 per cent last year and 0.8 percentage points slower than the IMF expected in October.

{"text": "NEW DELHI: Around 75% of the Covid positive samples, that underwent genome sequencing in January, were found to be infected with Omicron variant of SARS-CoV2, National Centre of Disease Control (NCDC) director Sujeet Singh said. He added that Delta also continues to have a significant presence in some states like Odisha, West Bengal and Maharashtra. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not true that we are seeing only the Omicron variant. Delta is still present in the country. Clinical severity is also due to Delta. Cases coming to hospitals should not be considered as Omicron and therefore of low severity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Singh said. In January, 9,672 samples were sequenced as Omicron infected cases, up from 1,292 in December. On the other hand, the proportion of samples detected with Delta infection was much higher in December at 17,272 compared with merely 4,789 such samples in January.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}
{"text": "Representative photo: PTINew Delhi: International travel could soon get more complicated and require constant booster shots atlas till the pandemic is over. Several countries in Europe will accept the vaccination certificate of a person for travel purposes if the final dose has been taken within a certain time period. \u00e2\u0080\u009cVaccines are considered only valid for 270 days. So if travellers got their last vaccine shot in April 2021, they cannot enter many EU countries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the southeast Asia head of a major European airline. Which means just like you check whether your passport is valid, you may have to start running the same checks with your jab certificate also. For Indians it could mean additional hurdles for travel to the EU as booster shots are allowed to very few like those above 60. Travel agents in India say time has come for WHO approved vaccines to be made readily available here for travellers to meet this new Covid-period compliance put in place by some EU countries. Other countries are also likely to follow suit. Airline officials are puzzled by such decisions and they want to be based on WHO advice only. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEnding Covid should not mean throttling every other industry except pharma,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said an airline senior official. According to Schengenvisainfo news, the EU Commission has recommended that all European countries agree on a uniform acceptance period for vaccination certificates after concluding that two-dose vaccinations do not provide sufficient protection against the virus. It has advised certificates remain valid for a period of 270 days. While some EU member states will implement this effective immediately, others opted for the different validity period. The website says this period ranges from France\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 90 days to Finland and Bulgaria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 365 days. Germany, Czech Republic, Italy, Ireland, Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Switzerland validity is 270 days. Austria is 180 days. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo-dose vaccinations are valid for 270 days to enter Austria. However, to prove your \u00e2\u0080\u00982-G' status during your stay in Austria, from February 1, 2022, the validity of your 2nd vaccination will be reduced to 180 days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Austria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s official travel portal says. Children are exempt from the requirement to receive an additional vaccine dose. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSwitzerland now accepts only vaccination certificates issued within the last 270 days. Such a decision was taken by the Swiss Federal Council and means that citizens of the country, as well as travellers, need to receive an additional vaccine does for their pass to be accepted,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Schengenvisainfo website says.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}
{"text": "(Photo credit: AIFF)NEW DELHI: The Indian senior men's national football team will play two international friendlies against Bahrain and Belarus on March 23 and 26 respectively, the sport's apex body announced on Friday. Both the matches will be played in Manama, Bahrain. The matches are part of the preparation for the national team campaign in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup third round qualifiers, which is scheduled to be held in June. \"Given the current circumstances, it was extremely difficult to find the kind of opponents we were looking for. But I am very happy that we have the two matches on our schedule,\" head coach Igor Stimac said. \"We are doing our best to prepare well for the upcoming final qualifying round of the AFC Asian Cup China 2023, and these two matches will immensely facilitate our preparatory process,\" he added. \"Both Bahrain and Belarus are ranked higher than us, and if all goes well with the Hero ISL season with our boys putting in good performances, and playing competitive games we should be ready,\" the coach said. Bahrain are placed at 91 in the FIFA rankings, while Belarus are on 94. India's current ranking is 104. The last time India played any UEFA member association was more than a decade ago in February 2012 against Azerbaijan, a match which the rivals won 3-0. \"Playing against better teams is the best way to improve our own game, as that allows the boys the chance to mature playing against, and with better speed. \"Our youngsters need more exposure and time to play, and practice. Sometimes results may suffer, but if we follow the path, we will have a better future soon,\" Stimac said. The Belarus contingent consists of many international players who ply their trade in the Russian Premier League (three players), and also the first league (three players), while a few more are also contracted with clubs in Hungary, Czech Republic and Cyprus. Stimac, who guided Croatia to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, also underlined the importance of taking \"necessary precautions, and staying safe.\" \"We need to keep planning, and working as everything is fine and normal. But at the same time, we need to take precautions to keep as safe as possible in our endeavour to avoid unpleasant situations,\" he expressed. With the broadcasting rights of matches lying with the Bahrain FA, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is in discussion with them, and also with the Belarus FA for live telecast of the games in India.FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailFacebookTwitterLinkedinEMail"}
{"text": "Joe Root (AP photo)LONDON: Joe Root was confirmed as England's Test captain for next month's tour of the West Indies by interim managing director Andrew Strauss on Friday despite leading the side in a woeful 4-0 series loss in Australia. But batting coach Graham Thorpe is the latest senior member of team management to pay the price for the Ashes humiliation, following the departures of managing director Ashley Giles and head coach Chris Silverwood.

(File)A century-old Hindu temple, which was vandalised and set on fire by an irate mob of radicals in northwest Pakistan last year, has been opened to devotees by Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed who had ordered authorities to reconstruct it, according to a media report on Tuesday.In December last year, century-old Shri Param Hans Ji Maharaj temple in Teri village in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Karak district was vandalised and demolished by a mob led by some local clerics belonging to the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F).Chief Justice Ahmed at the time ordered authorities to reconstruct the temple and instructed them to recover the money for the restoration work from the attackers whose act had caused \"international embarrassment\" to Pakistan.On Monday, Chief Justice Ahmed attended a grand function at the rebuilt temple to celebrate Diwali festival and to express solidarity with the members of the Hindu community, the Express Tribune newspaper reported.Addressing the inaugural ceremony, Chief Justice Ahmed said that the Supreme Court of Pakistan has always taken steps to protect the rights of minorities and it would continue to do so in the future, the paper reported.According to the Constitution, the Hindus enjoy the same rights as people of other religions in Pakistan, he was quoted as saying by the paper.While assuring that the Supreme Court will ensure protection of religious freedom to the country's minority communities, he asserted that no one has the authority to destroy or harm a religious place of worship belonging to another community.The community presented the Chief Justice with a turban and a digital Quran.He was invited to the event by the Pakistan Hindu Council, which also hosted pilgrims from Sindh and Balochistan provinces.Pakistan Hindu Council patron-in-chief and member of the National Assembly Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani expressed gratitude to the measures taken by the Chief Justice and the Supreme Court, the report said.Dr Vankwani, a senior leader of the ruling Tehreek-e-Insaaf Party headed by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, said that if similar steps are taken to inaugurate four other historic temples, it would help improve the country's image in the world, the report said.The rebuilt shrine is associated with a saint, Shri Param Hans Ji Maharaj, in Karak district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where the temple was established in 1920.Last month, the Pakistan top court also ordered the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial government to recover $1,94,161 from the culprits involved in vandalising the shrine.More than 100 people who were involved in the incident were arrested, as per the top court directive.In 1997, the shrine was first attacked and severely damaged, and Dr Vankwani had approached the Supreme Court in 2015 seeking help to restore the holy place and restart the annual pilgrimage.After the Supreme Court issued directives to the provincial government to restore and preserve the Teri temple, the Pakistan Hindu Council started holding the annual fair in 2015.Since the temple is being managed by the local Hindu families, it comes administratively under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province government and not under the Evacuee Trust Property Board's control.Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan.According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in the country.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comThe majority of Pakistan's Hindu population is settled in Sindh province where they share culture, traditions and language with Muslim residents.

(File)A petition has been filed in the Bombay High Court challenging the reservation of two per cent seats in Maharashtra public services for candidates belonging to the Special Backward Classes (SBCs) that was granted in 1994.The petition, filed by the Youth for Equality - the same organisation that had also challenged the Maratha reservation in the state - has claimed the two per cent quota for SBCs in Maharashtra government jobs is unconstitutional.The plea was listed for hearing in the HC on Monday, but could not be taken up due to paucity of time.The plea, filed through advocate Sanjeet Shukla, challenged a state government decision from the year 1994 that created the category of SBCs and provided for the two reservation for them in government jobs.The said provision takes the total percentage of reservation in government jobs for various special or scheduled categories to 52 per cent, breaching the Supreme Court-mandated limit, the petitioner pointed out.The organization cited the Supreme Court judgement that mandates that reservations in jobs must not exceed the upper ceiling of 50 per cent unless there exist extraordinary circumstances.The plea said the December 1994 state cabinet decision notifying the SBC category and granting them reservation was a political move as the relevant notification did not ever claim that the Special Backward Classes (SBCs) had any extraordinary circumstances attached to them.Besides, the SBCs are treated at par with the general category when it comes to seats in educational institutions in the state and they are eligible for reservation only if any OBC category seats remain vacant, it said.Even then, as per the Maharashtra government notification, the upper ceiling of 50 per cent reservation in education must not be breached, the plea said.The plea maintained the Maharashtra government has not made any efforts to \"find out if the castes included in the SBC category are backward, much less any data to show or prove their backwardness.\"\"The petitioner is aggrieved by the Maharashtra state notification dated December 8, 1994, thereby creating a new special category of SBCs and granting two per cent reservation in public services over and above the 50 per cent reservation already granted to other categories,\" it said.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comThe plea urged the HC to quash the notification issued 27 years ago.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"}

Because you are telling them and you're watching the tears roll down their face, but you're watching this weight lift off their shoulders,\" said 38-year-old Lindsay Bussick, who is Chaos Divers founder Jacob Grubbs' partner in the operation.Illinois-residents Bussick and Grubbs said their work was not simply an effort to get the clicks on YouTube that determine how much of a financial return a video may generate.\"I'm sorry that I have to bring this content like this to be able to help defend the next family,\" said Grubbs, a 38-year-old former coal miner.\"But this is a way that we have figured out to be able to fund the help for another family,\" he added.Adam Scott Wandt, an assistant professor of public policy at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, said untrained \"true-crime armchair sleuths\" and their efforts have become a cultural phenomenon in the past decade.But the results have varied greatly. He noted that some people pointed toward the social media swirl around slain US roadtripper Gabby Petito as helping police find her body this year.At the same time, internet sleuths tarred an innocent college student in the fear-stoked effort to find the attackers who set off homemade bombs that killed three at the 2013 Boston Marathon.\"The public is getting better at it, but it still can be very self-serving,\" added Wandt, noting the temptation for seeking clicks. \"But I'm definitely seeing more positive use over time.\"Working as a complement to police, rather than shovelling tips and theories at investigators, is one way that freelancers seem to have found a role.Police in the Sparta case said they had heard Sides was investigating in their area, but after noting he wasn't searching in the right place, they offered some advice on where to look.The bittersweet discovery followed days later.\"I ended my search in that river in town, and that's where I found them. It looks like a simple car accident,\" Sides told AFP.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\"They just went off the road and nobody saw them crash.

{"text": "The opposition party with the most number of cases is the Congress (File photo)Action by Central agencies against the BJP government's rivals and critics has witnessed a massive spike since the BJP-led government came to power in 2014, an NDTV analysis has found.Since 2014, Central agencies have targeted a whopping 570 of the government's political rivals and critics and in some cases, their family members as well. This massive sweep includes opposition politicians, non-NDA politicians, their relatives and aides, activists, lawyers, independent media houses or journalists, members of the film fraternity and even government officials who questioned the ruling party's conduct.Conversely, only 39 individuals linked to the BJP or its allies have faced the heat of central agencies such as the Central Bureau of Investigation, Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax in the past seven years.The category targeted the most is politicians -- 257 in all, and their relatives and associates, 140.The opposition party with the most number of cases is the Congress; 75 of the party have been targeted, followed by the Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress, 36 members of which have seen coercive action.The Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party is next, with cases against at least 18 of their members including Mr Kejriwal.As this slide shows, virtually no non-BJP political party has been untouched by Central agency action in the past 7 years -- from the Abdullah family and Mehbooba Mufti in Kashmir, to party colleagues and relatives of the DMK's Stalin in the Tamil Nadu.Apart from politicians and their relatives and aides, a wide swathe of government critics -- 121 in all -- have come under the scanner. From members of the film fraternity who have been vocal in their criticism of the government like Tapsee Pannu and director Anurag Kashyap, to bureaucrats like the tax cases against the relatives of Ashok Lavasa, the former Election Commissioner who gave dissenting opinions to the clean chits given to Prime Minister Modi and Amit Shah during the 2019 elections.Droves of Left-leaning activists seen as opposed to the BJP, like Sudha Bharadwaj and the others accused in the Bhima Koregaon case, have also been booked or arrested.29 media houses or journalists known for critical reporting on the government have also faced agency heat -- the most recent being raids on UP-based media houses Dainik Bhaskar, a mass-selling newspaper, and Bharat Samachar, a Lucknow-based TV channel that stood out for their hard-hitting reporting of the second Covid wave in UP.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The 570 figure is a massive 340 per cent increase compared to similar action under the Congress-led UPA 2 government, under whose watch 85 individuals or groups seen as critical of the Congress were targeted by Central agencies, working out to an average of 17 cases per year, compared to 75 cases a year under the Modi government.Under UPA-2, Central agencies seemed to act with more alacrity against the 'home team', taking action against 27 Congress members or party allies, a higher ratio compared to under the BJP.For every action against one of their own, the UPA -2 government acted against 3 of its rivals, while the Modi government took action against around 15 of its rivals, a five-fold increase.The NDTV analysis, the culmination of an almost 3-month exercise, was compiled using public domain information on reported instances of action taken by Central agencies including CBI, ED, Income Tax, as well as Delhi Police, an agency controlled by the Centre and actions taken by the Centrally-run J&K Administration.This is not an exhaustive list. Nor is this a comment on the merits of the cases.While the use of investigative agencies to target government critics is not new, the huge spike of cases targeting mainly one side, with little to no action against the BJP or its allies, raise questions over the Centre's claims that the actions are not politically coloured.Further, fuelling the perception of 'political' raids is the propensity of Central agencies to intensify the targeting of the BJP's rivals at crucial junctures, ahead of elections, for instance, or during political crises.Just this weekend, aides of Akhilesh Yadav, the BJP's main rival in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, were raided by tax authorities.Ahead of the West Bengal and Tamil Nadu elections earlier this year, Central agencies swooped down on at least 14 leaders, relatives and associates of the Trinamool Congress and of 8 the DMK, including raids on DMK chief MK Stalin's daughter and son in law just four days before the polls.Conversely, Central agencies have tended to overlook allegations of wrongdoing against BJP leaders at the Centre or in states. In Rajasthan and Karnataka, in 2020 and 2018, the Congress had released audio clips purportedly of the BJP attempting to bribe its legislators, including audio of an ex-BJP Chief Minister reportedly attempting to induce a Congress MLA, but no probe followed.Just a few of months ago, at least two BJP politicians have publicly spoken of how entry into the ruling party guarantees \"protection\" from Central agencies.Harshvardhan Patil, a former MLA from Maharashtra who had quit the Congress to join the BJP ahead of the 2019 state polls, said that he now gets \"sound sleep as there are no inquiries.\"PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\"He (referring to someone from the Opposition sitting next to him on stage) asked why did I join the BJP.

{"text": "Court documents showed Novak Djokovic was currently being detained at an address in MelbourneNovak Djokovic was again detained in Australia Saturday, after authorities ripped up his visa for a second time and declared the unvaccinated tennis superstar a threat to the public.Court documents showed the 34-year-old Serbian was currently being detained at an address in Melbourne, as his appeal against deportation is heard.Just two days before the Australian Open begins, the world number one is again focused on law courts rather than centre court in the latest twist in a high-profile row over his Covid-19 vaccine status.Immigration minister Alex Hawke now claims Djokovic's continued presence in the country could \"foster anti-vaccination sentiment\" and even spark an \"increase in civil unrest\".Djokovic was summoned to appear before immigration officials in Melbourne ahead of emergency Federal Court hearings on Saturday and Sunday.He was allowed to follow court proceedings from an address -- believed to be his lawyers' offices -- under guard of two Australian Border Force officers.This is the second attempt by Australia's conservative government to deport Djokovic, one of the world's most high-profile Covid-19 vaccine sceptics.The 34-year-old Serbian used a medical exemption to enter Australia earlier this month, hoping to challenge for a record 21st Grand Slam title at the Open.Amid public outcry, Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government revoked Djokovic's visa on arrival.Many Australians -- who have suffered prolonged lockdowns and border restrictions -- believe Djokovic gamed the system to dodge vaccine entry requirements.But the government was humiliated when a judge reinstated Djokovic's visa and allowed him to remain in the country.This time, the government has invoked exceptional -- and difficult to challenge -- executive powers to declare him a threat to public health and safety.The government argues that Djokovic's presence is a threat to public health and order, particularly as Australia suffers a tidal wave of Omicron infections.His continued presence in the country \"may pose a health risk to the Australian community\" by solidifying anti-vaccine sentiment and discouraging people from getting boosters, immigration minister Hawke argued, according to a court filing released Saturday.Djokovic's lawyers argue the government \"cited no evidence\" to support their claims.The minister admitted that Djokovic is at \"negligible\" risk of infecting Australians, but argued his past \"disregard\" for Covid-19 regulations may pose a risk to public health and encourage people to ignore pandemic rules.- 'Health and good order' -The tennis ace contracted Covid-19 in mid-December and, according to his own account, failed to isolate despite knowing he was positive.Public records show he attended a stamp unveiling, youth tennis event and granted a media interview around the time he got tested and his infection was confirmed.In a statement, Hawke said the government was \"firmly committed to protecting Australia's borders, particularly in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic\", citing \"health and good order grounds\" for the decision to cancel Djokovic's visa once again.The minister said \"it was in the public interest to do so\".The government has agreed not to deport Djokovic until the hearing is over, barrister Stephen Lloyd told an emergency late-night federal court session Friday.Djokovic is the Australian Open's top seed and a nine-time winner of the tournament. He had been practising just hours before Hawke's decision was announced.It is unclear if Djokovic will choose to stay and fight the case if he believes he is unable to compete in the Australian Open.Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on Friday accused Australia of \"mistreating\" the country's biggest star, and a national hero.\"If you wanted to ban Novak Djokovic from winning the 10th trophy in Melbourne why didn't you return him immediately, why didn't you tell him 'it is impossible to obtain a visa'?\" Vucic said on Instagram.\"Novak, we stand by you!\"- 'In the public interest' -Prime Minister Morrison backed the decision, saying: \"Australians have made many sacrifices during this pandemic, and they rightly expect the result of those sacrifices to be protected.\"The visa cancellation effectively means Djokovic would be barred from obtaining a new Australian visa for three years, except under exceptional circumstances, ruling him out of one of the four Grand Slam tournaments during that time.He is currently tied with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal with 20 Grand Slam titles each.Former world number one Andy Murray, who will play at the Open, said Friday he hoped Djokovic's status would be cleared up.\"It just seems like it's dragged on for quite a long time now and (it's) not great for the tennis, not great for the Australian Open, not great for Novak,\" Murray said.Other players, including world number four Stefanos Tsitsipas, have criticised Djokovic.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\"For sure he has been playing by his own rules,\" Tsitsipas told Indian broadcaster WION on Thursday.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"}
{"text": "Champion athletes are the epic heroes of the modern world. They embody certain virtues - fortitude, courage, endurance, grace and will - in a way that other sorts of celebrities can't. No matter how many social media followers a politician or a film star has, they are never given the unconditional admiration that the very greatest athletes command because politics and cinema are both seen as showbiz in these world-weary times. Only in sport is the public persona accepted unquestioningly as the real person. We instinctively suspect that men like Modi or Akshay Kumar work to build a public image, but we assume that with Jasprit Bumrah and Virat Kohli, what you see is what you get.That unquestioning faith is one of the reasons why sporting heroes are properly tragic figures when they fall from grace. When Mohammad Azharuddin and Ajay Jadeja were accused of match-fixing, horrified fans recoiled in a way that is unique to sport. No one is going to be appalled if, say, a newspaper reports that a charismatic Indian politician has taken a bribe or even murdered a rival. Nor is filmi fandom likely to gasp if it's revealed that a film star has connections with a criminal underworld. But when Steve Smith cheats, or Lance Armstrong is shown to have won his Tour de France titles with the help of performance-enhancing drugs, their audiences are almost theatrically shocked because even the most hard-bitten athlete is unquestioningly granted the presumption of innocence.Which brings us to curious case of Novak Djokovic. The greatest player in the history of professional men's tennis is locked in litigation against the Australian state, and apart from his Serbian compatriots, eccentric libertarians and raving anti-vaxxers, he seems to have no one on his side. This is especially odd because the role of Australian politicians, both federal and state, in creating this mess where Djokovic turns up in Australia with a visa and a seemingly valid exemption, and is then denied entry and detained, has been self-serving and shambolic.The Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, first tried to pass the buck to the state authorities, who promptly volleyed it back into Morrison's court, arguing that the country's borders were the federal government's business. Then, when Morrison realized that public opinion was outraged by the special exemption granted to a player infamous for his opposition to vaccination at a time when Australians have endured the most stringent rules to keep Covid under control, he decided to grandstand in the public interest. Djokovic's visa was cancelled by the immigration authorities.This ought to have been the perfect setting for a surge of sympathy for Djokovic, this spectacle of an athlete being thwarted by an opaque bureaucracy and calculating politicians. And for a moment, there was. An Australian court set aside the visa cancellation, ruling that Djokovic had been unfairly treated by the immigration authorities. Newspaper editors began to call on the Australian government to sort out this embarrassing mess. Nick Kyrgios, an Australian tennis player with a history of confrontation with Djokovic, said he was embarrassed as a tennis player and as an Australian at the way in which Djokovic had been treated.But the moment passed. At the time of writing, the Australian minister for immigration has exercised his discretion to cancel Djokovic's visa. Stefanos Tsitsipas, currently World No. 4, has publicly accused Djokovic of playing by his own rules and putting the Australian Open in jeopardy. Rafael Nadal has said pointedly that great tournaments are bigger than any individual tennis player. It's odd that this great player who has won the Australian Open nine times should have so little public support both in Australia and elsewhere.A large reason for this lack of sympathy is Djokovic's unvaccinated status. In this pandemic time, Djokovic's blithe disregard for precautionary rules and regulations strikes people as tone-deaf and entitled. His track record doesn't help. Djokovic organized a tennis tournament at the height of a Covid wave where unmasked, un-distanced players helped make the event a Covid hotspot. Australian public opinion shifted sharply against him because of new revelations about inconsistencies and misleading entries in his application to enter Australia to play the Australian Open.Djokovic had claimed a medical exemption on the grounds that he had recently been infected with Covid in mid-December and had recovered. It turned out that the day after this alleged infection, he had presented awards to young tennis players in Serbia and shortly after, had done a photoshoot with a French magazine. He had compounded these violations by falsely claiming on his travel declaration that he hadn't travelled in the fortnight before his departure for Australia, when he had, in fact, travelled between Belgrade and Spain.It's hard for a sporting public to sustain a faith in an athlete's innocence when he is caught out breaking rules and then lying about these violations. It comes across as a form of cheating - and nothing is more fatal to an athlete's reputation than that. But this isn't a sufficient explanation for the massive backlash against Djokovic. It's hard to imagine Nadal being treated by French immigration officials in this way, or indeed of Federer being detained by British border officials without the tennis fans of those countries rallying behind them for their great deeds at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. There's something else at work here.One straightforward explanation might be that Djokovic upended a rivalry between Federer and Nadal that the tennis public was very invested in, and these entrenched fans are actively hostile to the idea of the Serbian interloper dethroning their gods.\u00a0There is something to this. You might argue that there's no reason why Djokovic, arguably the greatest male tennis player ever, shouldn't have displaced Federer in the way Federer displaced Sampras, but you'd be wrong simply because Federer's rise coincided with the end of Sampras's career, while Djokovic has been forced to contend with the playing presence of two remarkably durable rivals.The unfairness of having to share his pomp with rivals who don't know when to retire has made Djokovic both indomitable - his win-loss record against Nadal and Federer speaks for itself - and needy. His transparent resentment that his great triumphs weren't met with full-throated public acclamation has pushed Djokovic into a curious passive-aggressive relationship with fans: he both craves their applause and taunts them for withholding it when he wins, as he usually does.Why do fans forgive Federer his narcissism and not Djokovic his foibles? Federer is capable of astonishing insensitivity. After beating Andy Roddick in five memorable sets in the final to win Wimbledon, he unzipped his kit bag and pulled out a jacket with 15 emblazoned on its back in gold and wore it, as if he were announcing to all the world that his victory had been a foregone conclusion. Unfairly, Federer's amazing grace makes his preening self-love seem a minor self-indulgence, but Djokovic's grinning prickliness darkens his less obvious genius like a five o'clock shadow.One reason for that is the historical baggage that Djokovic carries. He is the most famous Serbian in the world. He embodies Serbia, in the same way as his coach, Goran Ivanisovic, used to embody Croatia, both nations that emerged out of the genocidal civil war that tore Yugoslavia apart. Because of Serbia's responsibility for genocidal violence against Bosnian Muslims, Serbia's ethnic nationalism has something of the night about it. It is a revanchist nationalism that refuses to recognize Kosovo's status as an independent country. This sense of being a victim, of being hard done by, is hardwired into that nation's sense of self. Djokovic has done commercials that riff off the hardship of his childhood, growing up as he did in a country bombed into submission by US jets. During the current cock-up in Melbourne, his father, Srdjan Djokovic, claimed that his son was being crucified like Christ.In the cosmopolitan world of globalized tennis, Djokovic has chosen to cast himself as the undeferential, all-conquering provincial. His public scepticism about vaccination, his casual misogyny (five years ago he questioned the principle of equal prize money for men and women), and his aggrieved sense of destiny, make it all but certain that in difficult times (such as his ongoing wrangle with the Australian state), he will inspire more schadenfreude than sympathy. He will almost certainly win that twenty-first Grand Slam title and edge ahead of Federer and Nadal in the G.O.A.T stakes, at once unequalled and unloved.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comMukul Kesavan is a writer based in Delhi.

{"text": "Nearly 7.9 billion people occupy 29.2 per cent of Earth\u2019s total area. This comes to nearly 5 acre land per person if divided equally. India occupies 2.4 per cent of the total land area but supports over 18 per cent of the global population. Each person in India gets approximately 0.5 acres of land, and even this number is shrinking, leading to scarcity in resources and making survival difficult.India\u2019s population is seen as the biggest obstacle to its economic development. A country\u2019s population should be its asset. India is still in the developing stage and controlling the growing population will help us build a more educated society. Only if per capita income increases and a family has enough to spend on a child\u2019s education, we can see India grow and shine on the global stage.India adds roughly 2 crore people every year to its population. And, effective population control measures are the need of the hour. Despite major successes in the fields of industrialization, science and technology, it has become difficult to meet the basic needs of the citizens in the country, be it clean air, pure water or unadulterated food. Does this not violate the Right to Life enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution? A burgeoning population and consequently the exploitation of natural resources have left our rivers in a sorry state and our wildlife endangered.In 1968, the Foreign Policy Association celebrated its 15th anniversary and invited thousands of scientists from around the world to a three-day conference to discuss how the world might look in 50 years\u2019 time. After three days of discussion and suggestions from the scientists, a book \u201cToward the Year 2018\u201d was published. A cursory reading of the book will tell us how we have ignored their suggestions, particularly on population.Population Clock: India Fertility Rate Sees Massive Drop Than That of China's, Data ShowsIndia\u2019s Demographic Danger: An Assault on Life\u2019s Basic NeedsLate theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking had warned against the perils of rapid increase in population and argued that humanity may eventually have to inhabit another planet to survive. In 2017, more than 15,000 scientists across 184 countries in a global statement flagged population growth as one of the gravest problems. Earlier in 1992, over 1,700 scientists had published a warning against population growth, among other negative trends that could put human survival at risk, immediately after the world population crossed the 5 billion-mark.Several parliamentarians over the years have risen above partisan politics and introduced private member bills on population control\u201440 such bills have been introduced in Parliament since Independence. Among them, Congress (16) leads the pack, followed by BJP (12), Telugu Desam Party (5), AIADMK (2) and one each from Trinamool Congress, Revolutionary Socialist Party, Samajwadi Party, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena and Rashtriya Janata Dal. However, it is unfortunate that such a serious subject has not been debated even once.In 1992, then health and family welfare minister M.L. Fotedar had introduced The Constitution (Seventy-Ninth Amendment) Bill in the Rajya Sabha \u201cto promote population control and the small family norm\u201d, but it was not discussed in the Rajya Sabha.ALSO READ | EXPLAINED: Why UP, Assam Think Two-Child Policy Will Help Check Population GrowthIn 2018, Member of Parliament Sanjeev Balyan had submitted \u201cThe Responsible Parenthood Bill\u201d\u2014which I had drafted\u2014as a private member bill in Lok Sabha. A total of 125 parliamentarians had written to then Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan for a discussion in the House on the pending private member bills on population control during the 2018 winter session. However, a time was not allotted to it.In the recent past, whenever parliamentarians have asked questions related to population control, the government has always referred to the ICPD (International Conference on Population and Development), stating that India is bound by its rules and, therefore, it is not possible to bring any legislation for population control. In 2015, J.C. Diwakar Reddy and Parvesh Sahib Singh and in 2017, D.K. Suresh and Uday Pratap Singh received similar replies.However, an examination of the ICPD manifesto reveals that if the government desires, it can adhere to the restrictions imposed by ICPD and still bring an India-specific law. Any country can adopt processes and legislation for population control and family planning measures as per their applicable legal provisions and culture.The Indian government as well as all states have the power to pass legislation on population control and family planning as per point 20 A in the concurrent list of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution of India. This was included through the 42nd Constitutional Amendment 1976 and is effective since January 1, 1977.In February 2000, then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee constituted the National Commission to Review the Working of Constitution, headed by Justice Venkatachaliah. After two years of in-depth study, a report of 1979 pages was presented to then Law and Justice Minister Arun Jaitley in March 2002. The commission proposed a provision of small families for the purpose of population control, but it was never tabled in Parliament.According to present data, some 2.40 crore babies are born every year in India whereas around 88 lakh people die each year. Simply put, the population is growing by 1.5 crore people per annum.As per the 2011 Census, India had 33,96,21,277 married women and of them, 18,19,74,153 had two or fewer children. This indicates that despite family planning programmes\u2014and the government spending an estimated Rs 2.5 lakh crore (present day value would be around Rs 25 lakh crore) on such initiatives since 1974\u201415,76,47,124 women still had more than two children.Around 65 per cent of the population in India (or 90 crore people) is under 35 years of age. Even if India is successful in limiting the population growth to the global replacement rate (which is 2.1 live births per woman), an estimated 90 crore babies will be born over the next 35 years. It will not be an aberration to say that one can expect India to become a 2 billion-plus country in the next 35 years.It is, therefore, imperative that we undertake special measures to control India\u2019s population. A rapidly rising population causes social, economic and environmental imbalances in the country. Poverty, unemployment, pollution, adulteration, crimes etc. are on the rise as a result of the increasing population.Social awareness campaigns are clearly not enough. They need to go hand-in-hand with clear and effective population control policies. Assam and Uttar Pradesh governments are moving in the right direction and they should be appreciated.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here"}

He refused to sign non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreements in exchange for a severance payment.Im fed up with people telling me in that organization what to say, how to say it, and what to believe, said Johnson, who was hired in 2010 as the BSAs first youth protection director.A spokesperson for the Boy Scouts said there was no attempt to buy Johnsons silence and the terms in the severance package were the same as those for other eligible employees who were terminated.Asked why he decided to step forward now, Johnson said he began to sense in recent years that the Boy Scouts were becoming less receptive to needed reforms.All of the sudden, I wasnt able to make the changes that were needed, and there were excuses and omissions\u2026. I felt, naively, that I could make change within the organization, and there were some successes, but it wasnt nearly enough, he said.Johnsons decision to speak out comes amid a key point in the Boy Scouts of American bankruptcy case, as ballots are being distributed to tens of thousands of men who say they were molested as children by scoutmasters and others to vote on whether to approve the BSAs reorganization plan.The Boy Scouts, based in Irving, Texas, sought bankruptcy protection in Delaware in February 2020, seeking to halt hundreds of individual lawsuits and create a fund for men who say they were sexually abused as children. Although the organization was facing 275 lawsuits at the time, its facing more than 82,000 sexual abuse claims in the bankruptcy case.In an article published in August 2019, just six months before the bankruptcy filing, Johnson defended efforts by the Boy Scouts to protect children from sexual abuse.Contrary to many inaccurate reports, our youth protection policies are in line with  and sometimes even ahead of  societys knowledge of abuse and best practices for preventing abuse, he wrote. We actively share and continually improve these policies through our mandatory youth protection training, our ongoing collaborations with groups such as the Centers for Disease Control and youth-serving organizations, and continuous engagement with survivors of abuse and top experts in this area.The child safety policies and procedures we utilize are among the most advanced and comprehensive of any youth-serving organization today, he added.The Boy Scouts issued a statement Tuesday expressing appreciation for Johnsons dedication to youth safety and for the effect he had on the organization.We are disappointed to hear Mr. Johnsons characterization of the program he spearheaded and the concerns he raised, especially given his past public support for the robust measures the BSA instituted at his recommendation, the statement read.Today, Scouting is safer than ever before, the statement adds, citing many policies that have been implemented in recent years.While any instance of abuse is one too many, its important to know that the vast majority of claims in the BSAs Chapter 11 case predate our modern youth protection policies. Specifically, 85% or more of the claims allege a first instance of abuse prior to 1990, and 50% or more of the claims allege a first instance of abuse prior to 1974.In an Oct. 6 letter to Congress, Johnson urged lawmakers to begin investigations and hearings into the high risk of child sexual abuse that exists within Scouts BSA.Scouts BSA is the traditional Scouting experience for children in fifth grade through high school, according to the BSAs website.In the letter, Johnson touted several improvements in youth protection policies during his tenure but nevertheless described them as drop in the bucket better suited for low-risk organizations, not high-risk organizations such as the Boy Scouts.Throughout my time at Scouts BSA, I witnessed decisions being made that showed the top priority of the organization was not the safety of children, but the preservation of the reputation and brand of the institution and its top sponsoring organizations, Johnson wrote.By way of example, Johnson said more than half of reported sexual abuse incidents in the Boy Scouts were perpetrated by other youth, which he blamed on lack of adult supervision and the large age range at many events.He also said BSA lacked proper screening procedures and reference checks for adult volunteers and leaders, and that known offenders are still volunteering and still have access to children because of a lack of accountability by troop sponsoring organizations such as churches and civic groups.Johnson proposed a dozen action steps in his letter to Congress, including a review of the BSAs federal charter and an independent task force to study youth-on-youth sexual abuse. He also called for the public release of information regarding decades-old ineligible volunteer files or perversion files, listing Scout leaders and volunteers suspected or convicted of abusing children.Disclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editorRead all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here.

On Tuesday, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency in terms of market value was last down 3.6% at $55,402.Since a low of $28,600 hit in June, bitcoin has gained about 88% of its value.Blockchain data provider Glassnode, in its latest research note, said bitcoin experienced a boost in network activity in the first week of October, suggesting new demand is beginning to enter in the fourth quarter.In addition, Glassnode said the positive sentiment and constructive price action has also started to creep back into the derivatives markets amid climbing open interest and rising swap funding rates.Ethereum, meanwhile, saw minor outflows totaling $14 million, data showed, as it continues to lose market share to bitcoin. Its market share has fallen 1% to 24% of assets under management in the last week alone.Other altcoins such as solana and cardano posted inflows of $12.5 million and $3 million, respectively, data showed.

Georgia Democratic Party spokesperson Dan Gottlieb said in a statement.Former President Donald Trump urged the football great and his longtime friend to enter the race for the Republican nomination against Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in 2022. Walker is running against three other Republicans, including Georgia state Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black.The fundraiser required a $500 donation to get in and $5,800 for a VIP private reception.

{"text": "U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday signed an order imposing new vaccine requirements for most foreign national air travellers and lifting severe travel restrictions on China, India and much of Europe effective Nov. 8, the White House said.The extraordinary U.S. travel restrictions were first imposed in early 2020 to address the spread of COVID-19. The rules bar most non-U.S. citizens who within the last 14 days have been in Britain, the 26 Schengen countries in Europe without border controls, Ireland, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil.It is in the interests of the United States to move away from the country-by-country restrictions previously applied during the COVID-19 pandemic and to adopt an air travel policy that relies primarily on vaccination to advance the safe resumption of international air travel to the United States, Biden\u2019s proclamation says.The White House confirmed that children under 18 are exempt from the new vaccine requirements as are people with some medical issues. Non-tourist travelers from nearly 50 countries with nationwide vaccination rates of less than 10% will also be eligible for exemption from the rules. Those receiving an exemption will generally need to be vaccinated within 60 days after arriving in the United States. Those countries include Nigeria, Egypt, Algeria, Armenia, Myanmar, Iraq, Nicaragua, Senegal, Uganda, Libya, Ethiopia, Zambia, Congo, Kenya, Yemen, Haiti, Chad and Madagascar.Thailand Announces Quarantine-free Travel for 45 Nations. Check What It Means for IndiaAfter COVID-19 Lull, 72% Indians Want to Travel Next Year: SurveyThe White House first disclosed on Sept. 20 that it would remove restrictions in early November for fully vaccinated air travelers from 33 countries. Families and friends can see each other again, tourists can visit our amazing landmarks. This policy will further boost economic recovery, State Department spokesman Ned Price said.The Biden administration also detailed requirements airlines must follow to confirm foreign travelers have been vaccinated before boarding U.S.-bound flights. One concern among U.S. officials and airlines is making sure foreign travelers are aware of the new vaccine rules that will take effect in just two weeks as well unvaccinated Americans who will face stricter testing rules.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued on Monday new contact tracing rules requiring airlines to collect information from international air passengers like phone numbers, email and U.S. addresses and retain it for 30 days in case it needed to follow up with travelers who have been exposed to COVID-19 variants or other pathogens.The CDC said this month it would accept any vaccine authorized for use by U.S. regulators or the World Health Organization and will accept mixed-dose coronavirus vaccines from travelers.That list leaves off the Sputnik vaccine that has been used by Latin American countries extensively. In Mexico, the government has said it plans to use its 24 million doses of Sputnik to inoculate nearly 9% of the population. A Biden administration official said Monday that some other major vaccines are going to be under review as the data on performance of those vaccines becomes available in a regulatory process.The Transportation Security Administration plans to issue a security directive that provides the legal basis for airlines implenting the vaccine requirements. The attestation form  notes it is a crime for air travelers lie about vaccination status.The CDC said there are no religious exemptions for international travelers seeking to avoid COVID-19 requirements.Foreign air travelers will need to provide vaccination documentation from an official source and airlines must confirm the last dose was at least two weeks earlier than the travel date.International air travelers will need to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken within three days prior to departure. The White House said unvaccinated Americans and foreign nationals receiving exemptions will need to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test within one day of departing.The Biden administration plans to issue details later this week of its parallel plans to lift restrictions to land border crossings on Nov. 8 for vaccinated foreign nationals.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here.

While several schools reopened with 50 per cent strength on Monday, majority of privately-run schools have deferred the reopening to post-Diwali.According to government officials, students came to schools in large numbers but they practiced a lot of caution \u2014 masks, thermal scanning, and volunteers guiding staggered entry and exit for students were common sights at the schools. Some schools welcomed the students with dance and music, while others decided to screen films like \u201cTare Zameen Par\u201d for the students.Many other activities were also organised to help the children connect with their schools, before resuming physical education. \u201cIt was an emotional moment to see students laughing and enjoying in classrooms. We welcome all students back to school,\u201dDelhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia tweeted Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the childhood of kids is incomplete without visiting schools. \u201cWe have to leave the tough time behind and move on,\u201d he tweeted in Hindi.

The government is alert and committed to ensure children\u2019s health and safety. It will be ensured that all schools follow all COVID-19 protocols and observe social distancing. If there is any third wave or rise in cases, schools can be closed again, he said. An overwhelmingly positive response was observed on the very first day of school reopening, which demonstrates the parents\u2019 confidence in sending their children to school, he said.At the Government CO-ED Senior Secondary School, Lajpat Nagar, a class 8 student said, \u201cI am excited to attend school regularly henceforth. It felt good to be back after almost two years.\u201d Online classes were definitely useful but during physical classes, we can always clear our doubts then and there. Due to network issues, sometimes, we don\u2019t get a clear picture of what\u2019s going on and it is quite tiring for eyes to keep looking at the screen for so long,\u201d the student said. Another student, who was equally excited to join the school, said, Even during Covid times, our teachers did take all efforts to take our classes sincerely and give us attention individually too. We could approach them individually to clear our doubts.Even though they were available, we still felt something was missing \u2014 the fun of meeting our friends and coming to school. I hope the classes don\u2019t get affected because of the possibility of the third wave\u201d. Teachers at many Delhi government schools said even though the attendance was low on the first day of reopening, they expect more students after Diwali. They said they are making all efforts required to bring them back to classrooms just like earlier but this time keeping Covid-19 protocols in practice.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had last week announced that schools would reopen for all classes from November 1, even though teaching and learning would continue in blended mode. The DDMA had also said that schools would have to ensure that there is not more than 50 per cent attendance in a class at one point of time and no student is forced to attend physical classes.Following a marked improvement in the COVID-19 situation in the national capital, the Delhi government had announced the reopening of schools for classes 9 to 12, colleges, and coaching institutions from September 1. However, this is the first time after March 2020 that schools in Delhi are reopening for classes up to 8. Allowing only 50 per cent of students per classroom, mandatory thermal screening, staggered lunch breaks, alternate seating arrangement and avoiding routine guest visits are among the guidelines announced by the DDMA for the reopening of schools. The DDMA has said students, teachers and non-teaching staff living in Covid containment zones will not be allowed to come to schools and colleges.It has also said the area being used for activities like ration distribution and vaccination should be separated from the area that will be used for academic activities.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here.

{"text": "A real estate agent from suburban Dallas who flaunted her participation in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol on social media and later bragged she wasn\u2019t going to jail because she is white, has blond hair and a good job was sentenced on Thursday to two months behind bars. While some rioters sentenced for the same misdemeanor conviction have received only probation or home confinement, prosecutors sought incarceration for Jennifer Leigh Ryan of Frisco, Texas, saying she has shown a lack of candor and remorse for her actions when the pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol building and delayed Congress\u2019 certification of Joe Biden\u2019s Electoral College victory. They also said Ryan\u2019s belief that she\u2019s shielded from punishment shows she doesn\u2019t grasp the seriousness of her crime.Ryan wasn\u2019t facing a felony for more serious conduct, but U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper said she was still among the mob who overnumbered police in an attack that led to the deaths of five people and will have a lasting effect on government institutions.Though Ryan said she was sorry for her actions, Cooper questioned whether she is remorseful and has respect for the law.\u201cYour actions since Jan. 6 make me doubt some of those things,\u201d the judge said.Prosecutors said Ryan traveled to Washington on a jet chartered by a Facebook friend, described Trump\u2019s rally before the riot as a prelude to war, livestreamed her entry into the building as alarms sounded, participated in chants of \u201cFight For Trump,\u201d tweeted a photo of herself next to broken windows outside the Capitol and later said she deserved a medal for what she did.Her lawyer responded that she was in the building for only two minutes, didn\u2019t act violently and has a First Amendment right to speak up on social media.The judge then referred to Ryan\u2019s March 26 tweet in which she wrote, \u201cDefinitely not going to jail. Sorry I have blonde hair white skin a great job a great future and I\u2019m not going to jail. Sorry to rain on your hater parade. I did nothing wrong.\u201dIn a letter to the judge, Ryan denied believing she was immune to punishment, saying she was responding to people who made fun of her appearance and called for her to be imprisoned. She said her attorney told her at the time that prosecutors would be recommending a sentence of probation.\u201cI was attacked and I was answering them,\u201d Ryan said in court.She is the 10th person charged in the Jan. 6 attack to get a jail or prison sentence. More than 650 people have been charged for their actions at the Capitol.Prosecutors said Ryan has since downplayed the violence at the Capitol and falsely claimed to probation authorities that she didn\u2019t know there was a riot until she came to the Capitol, even though she had recorded herself in a hotel room watching news coverage of rioters climbing the walls of the Capitol.After the riot, Ryan said she faced a backlash that included death threats, public heckling and graffiti painted on her real estate signs. She said she had to change her name and disguise herself in public.Ryan tweeted a photo of herself next to broken windows and holding her fingers in a V sign, with a caption saying, \u201cWindow at The capital. And if the news doesn\u2019t stop lying about us we\u2019re going to come after their studios next\u2026\u201dShortly afterward, Ryan posted another tweet about a crowd damaging equipment belonging to news organizations, including The Associated Press. She tweeted it was a \u201ccool moment\u201d when rioters \u201cwent to town on the AP equipment.\u201dRyan is expected to start serving her sentence in January.Also on Thursday, an Air Force veteran was sentenced to three years of probation for breaching the Capitol and taking photos and videos while inside the rotunda for about 10 minutes.Jonathan Ace Sanders, 61, of Vincennes, Indiana, served 20 years in the military and was awarded a Purple Heart, but said he failed his training on Jan. 6.\u201cI wasn\u2019t tricked, I wasn\u2019t pushed, that was my failure \u2026 I am sincerely sorry,\u201d he said.Sanders is among dozens of veterans and active-service members charged in connection with the insurrection. As they have in other cases, prosecutors argued that should mean a tougher sentence for Sanders because his training should have told him to leave as other rioters attacked Capitol police officers and vandalized the building.U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols declined to impose the two months of home confinement that prosecutors recommended. The judge said Sanders\u2019 military career was commendable service to his country, but also should have kept him away.\u201cIn my view, his service cuts both ways,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cIt should have been obvious to him this was a violent riot.\u201dEarlier on Thursday, a Maryland woman who joined the mob\u2019s attack also was sentenced to three years of probation, including two months of home detention.Brittiany Angelina Dillon said her actions at the Capitol were \u201cinexcusable and unacceptable.\u201d Judge Dabney Friedrich said text messages show Dillon clearly anticipated violence when she went to Washington on Jan. 6 and seemed intent on doing her part to stop Congress from certifying Biden\u2019s victory.According to prosecutors, Dillon pushed through a crowd of rioters to approach an entrance to the Capitol but was pushed back before she could make it beyond the building\u2019s threshold.The judge said she was troubled by statements that Dillon made before and after the riot, including her reference to law enforcement officers as \u201cdevils.\u201d\u201cThe attack she participated in was an attack on our institutions of government, the rule of law and our democratic process,\u201d Friedrich said. _____ Billeaud reported from Phoenix and Whitehurst from Salt Lake City.

According to a report in Android Central, an alarming number of users are getting ear infections after using the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro and Galaxy Buds 2. It is not known as to what is causing the infections, but it is likely due to the new materials used in their construction.Samsung has not released a statement on this issue, but the company is reportedly giving affected users a full refund and in some cases, it is even footing their medical bills. Given that the company is offering refunds, it is a given that they are aware of the issue. However, there is no official statement from the South Korean manufacturer yet. The report in Android Central points out that no user has complained of any issues with the earlier models of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds, but the newer models cause varying levels of irritation. This, the report says could be due to the Galaxy Buds Pro\u2019s usage of Nickel which is known to cause skin irritation for some people. Samsung has also used a new material called acrylate on the new Galaxy Buds 2 models, which may just be reason.Some people have already proposed a class-action lawsuit against Samsung under the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act.

In order to raise the money, Banksy has reportedly agreed to sell the stencil which he used to paint on the building and raise \u00a310 million to help convert the building into an arts centre.Many celebrities including Hollywood actors Sir Kenneth Branagh, Kate Winslet, Natalie Dormer and Dame Judi Dench have got behind the campaign to convert the abandoned building into an arts centre rather than turning it over for housing property.The BBC had quoted the artist as saying, \u201cI had very little interest in Reading until I was on a rail replacement bus service that went past the jail.

{"text": "Omicron is producing a more hopeful pattern to the previously dominant Delta variant of COVID-19 in terms of numbers of people needing ventilators and length of time spent in intensive care units (ICUs), a senior UK Cabinet minister said on Monday. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said the government is closely monitoring the hospitalisation data as more over-50s are now among those being infected by the Omicron variant.However, this group is also among those almost 90 per cent boosted with top-up third vaccine doses, which should protect against severe disease.On the whole, we are not seeing the same pattern as with Delta, where we had much greater numbers of people on ventilators, said Zahawi. \u201dAnd there seems to be a shorter period of time with people in ICU as well, and those who are being admitted with COVID rather than for COVID is also about a third of that number,\u201d he said.The minister echoed some of his other Cabinet colleagues in expressing the hope that further lockdown restrictions may not be required even though COVID-19 infections remain high, as the Omicron spread in England showed some signs of slowing down with 137,583 infections recorded on Sunday, lower than Saturday\u2019s 162,572. \u201dThe number of people in hospital with coronavirus have begun to rise in the over-50s, which we are concerned about, but on the whole, actually the number of people in ICU (intensive care) has come down, which is good news,\u201d Zahawi told Sky News\u2019.Don't Sit Back Thinking Omicron is Milder, Take Vaccines, Says Top ExpertMaha Records 12,160 New Covid-19  Cases, 11 Deaths; Omicron Tally Up by 68 to 578\u201dIf we see more leakage of infection in the over-50s because most of the surge in infections from the Omicron variant has been in the under-50s then that is more likely that those people end up with severe infection and hospitalisation. But the good news is obviously that 90 per cent of those people over 50 have had the booster jab that is the real protection against severe infection and hospitalisation, he said. \u201dSo, at the moment there\u2019s nothing in the data to suggest we need to go further but of course, we will look at the Wednesday review and then beyond that keep monitoring the data very carefully,\u201d he added.The education minister also vowed that the move towards compulsory face masks in secondary schools as term begins later this week will not be in place \u201dfor a day longer than we need it\u201d. It was announced over the weekend that pupils returning to school after Christmas break will be required to wear face masks in class and also undergo on-site rapid antigen lateral flow tests. What we\u2019re saying is, look, with Omicron, because it\u2019s so infectious, we want to make sure that we give you as many tools to be able to make sure that education is open,\u201d he said.The government is set to review the data in full on Wednesday to evaluate any changes to the current Plan B measures, which require compulsory face coverings, work from home and COVID vaccination passes for large venues, echoes the views of other Cabinet ministers in recent days. The devolved regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all following similar restrictions but in most cases have gone even further than England and imposed restrictions on crowd sizes and banned nightclubs. Chris Hopson, CEO of NHS Providers behind staffing levels at the state-funded National Health Service (NHS), said that the number of hospitalisations has \u201ddropped significantly\u201d in London the first region to be hit hard by Omicron as its epicentre. That could mean the number of hospitalisations in the British capital is now matching an earlier peak in cases, with regions beyond London now beginning to feel the pressure.Rest of country now under pressure.

Recent London data, fact that London/NHS currently coping\u2019 and absence of large numbers of seriously ill offer grounds for optimism.

{"text": "Addressing the nation during \u2018Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav\u2019 on Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an important announcement regarding the government\u2019s priority to ensure that every person has access to nutrition. It was announced that the government will supply fortified rice to women and children under schemes like the Public Distribution System (PDS) and PM-POSHAN (formerly known as the Mid-Day Meal Scheme) by 2024.The announcement came as the country was preparing to reinvigorate its efforts to tackle malnutrition by deploying scientific, evidence-based and innovative methods.The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India\u2019s (FSSAI\u2019s) Food Fortification Resource Centre (FFRC) reported that over 70% of India\u2019s population consumes less than half the daily recommended dietary allowance of micronutrients. These deficiencies are prevalent not only in women and children from rural areas but also affect population groups in urban India.To address these issues, the Government of India has already put in place several measures like Anganwadis, the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana and the Scheme for Adolescent Girls under the umbrella Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme.Women's Agricultural Labour Cause of Malnutrition in Rural IndiaIndia Staring at Mass Malnutrition as Carbon Dioxide Levels Soar, Warns StudyOther social safety nets including the Public Distribution System, Antodaya Anna Rozgar Yojana, PM-POSHAN Scheme and the landmark 2013 Food Security Act are also collectively working towards India\u2019s Zero Hunger goal. India\u2019s free school lunch programme is one of the world\u2019s largest anti-poverty measures.Key to Addressing Nutrition GapMoreover, in a bid to directly address anaemia and micronutrient deficiency in the country, the Centre recently approved a pilot scheme on \u201cFortification of Rice & its Distribution under Public Distribution System\".The government\u2019s food fortification initiative is already taking shape with several states, including Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Telangana, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh, starting the distribution of fortified rice under the pilot programme.With a section of the populace having limited access to nutritious food, fortification is key in addressing the nutrition gap. Fortifying staple foods and condiments with key micronutrients is an effective way of addressing deficiencies. Timely adoption of food fortification in social and nutrition security programmes as a part of the fortification initiative will play a crucial role in addressing undernutrition in India.Fortification is one of the most effective nutrition interventions in preventing nutritional deficiencies and contributing to India\u2019s progress towards achieving UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2.2 of \u2018ending all forms of malnutrition by 2030\u2019.Necessary InterventionsAdditionally, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), food fortification (including biofortification) and dietary diversification modify diet quality and diversity to address multiple micronutrient deficiencies and possibly help reduce the risk of diet-related health issues.\u201cFood-based nutrition interventions have a strong potential to enhance food security by improving food production and availability, processing, supply, and commercialisation, all while facilitating its access and consumption for improved nutrition outcomes,\u201d the world health body has said.In India, pilot projects led by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) on the integration of fortified rice in the PM-POSHAN have been carried out in several districts of Odisha between January 2013 and October 2018, and in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, from 2018 to 2020. The WFP has said that the project helped reduce anaemia among school children.Why Rice?Micronutrients such as iron are vital for the healthy development of children. Therefore, rice-fortification, as per WHO\u2019s list of Evidence for Nutrition Actions (eLENA), is one of the most effective ways of addressing micronutrient malnutrition.The Government of India has taken note of the high-level impact food fortification can have in fighting micronutrients malnutrition. Based on case studies complied in the FSSAI-FFRC compendium on fortification, consumption of fortified rice shows an increase in haemoglobin concentrations, plasma and vitamin B-12, and a decrease in homocysteine levels, iron deficiency and anaemia.Under a pilot project through the PDS and school feeding programme, fortified rice is being provided to families and children in government and government-aided schools. If the supply is further increased, it could aid in fighting malnutrition and other deficiencies to a large extent.Among other things, rice fortification involves manufacturing fortified rice kernels and blending them with the regularly consumed rice. But why focus on rice over flour? According to PATH, an organisation working on fortification in India since 2005, rice is more widely consumed across the country and therefore, extensive behaviour change is not necessary for rice fortification. In contrast, a more widespread shift would be required for flour fortification to work.Since, most vulnerable people may already be those with limited access to industrially-milled flour, fortified rice, can be a game-changer in addressing child malnutrition.Other food items issued by the FSSAI for mandatory fortification include wheat flour, maida, salt, refined edible vegetable oil and milk.Impact So Far and Forward MotionAs per FSSAI-FFRC case studies, regular intake of fortified milk resulted in 18% lower incidence of diarrhea and 26% lower incidence of pneumonia, while the consumption of fortified edible oil depicted a significant 90% drop in cases of xerothalimia (abnormal dryness of the conjunctiva and cornea of the eye), and the continuous usage of fortified wheat flour showed decrease in anaemia levels.The results are a testament that the decision to supply fortified rice to women and children through various schemes is an important step towards a malnutrition-free India.However, to ensure complete nutritional security to everyone, a continued, healthy coordination between the Centre and state governments is necessary. Alongside capacity building in the public sector, the need of the hour is to implement best-in-class procurement and distribution models of fortified foods while managing economics and giving due importance to quality control.Shridhar Venkat is CEO of Akshaya Patra Foundation.

He was political unknown before he started spending more than $2.8 million of his own money and a political group funded by his father pumped in about $1 million more into a television advertising-heavy campaign, helping him win a crowded 2016 Republican primary.Political opponents dubbed him Tennessee Trey, trying to highlight his time growing up near Knoxville, Tennessee, and family wealth as his father, Joseph Hollingsworth Jr., founded Hollingsworth Companies, where he made a fortune developing commercial and industrial properties across the South.His 2016 congressional financial disclosure showed a net worth of at least $50 million and earnings of at least $1.4 million a year.Democrats criticized Hollingsworth as planning to use that wealth for a statewide campaign.Its no secret that Tennessee Trey will try to buy his way into the governors office in 2024 and attempt to lead an Indiana Republican Party that continues to push their extreme culture wars ahead of a better future for Hoosier families, Indiana Democratic Party spokesman Drew Anderson said.Disclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editorRead all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here."}

Indeed, we Indians have a calorie-rich diet, from parathas for breakfast to cream-loaded Lassi for lunch.But, the required calorie intake of the body depends from person to person. If you think you have a hyperactive lifestyle that makes you exhausted and helps burn loads of calories, then munching a bit extra would not do any harm. On the other hand, if your physical activity is near to zero and you still consume excessive calories, then it can lead to rapid weight gain.When it comes to weight loss, people usually prefer non-desi foods like quinoa, oats and Greek yoghurt, which are also not easily available. But not many know that even our Indian diet has an abundance of low-calorie food options. These light foods not only facilitate weight loss but each one of them comes with their own benefits.Let us have a look at some of these Indian foods which you can eat guilt free.What the Fork: Poha, Bhutte Ka Kees, Garadu, Kunal Vijayakar On Indore\u2019s Sinful Street FoodWATCH: Gwalior Stall's Eco-friendly Way of Serving Poha in Leaf is a WinPoha is the go-to breakfast for many Indians, and it\u2019s not only delicious but low in calories as well. Made by flattening parboiled rice, a bowl of poha can have as little as 180 calories. Poha is even quite easy to digest for your system and keeps you full for longer and thus contributes to your weight loss journey.Chickpeas or Kabuli chana in Hindi is another food that is low-calorie and at the same time super nutritious. Being rich in fibre and protein, it also provides your body with essential nutrients while keeping your weight loss plan on track.Bajra Khichdi is a popular food in the western region especially the state of Rajasthan. Loaded with nutrients like iron, magnesium, protein and fibre, Bajra is exceptionally low in calories while high in nutritional value, which makes it an ideal weight loss food.Being a popular street food, Bhel is often considered unhealthy but surprisingly if you ditch the extra sauces and chutneys, Bhel can be an effective weight loss snack. It is basically puffed rice which is very light and can be prepared in various lip-smacking ways.Upma is another popular low-calorie breakfast which is usually eaten in the southern regions of India. Made with semolina, Upma can be an excellent choice for weight loss as it digests slowly and steadily provides you with energy.

{"text": "A short film featuring an NCP MP, which is scheduled to release this month, has created a stir in Maharashtra. The movie- \u201cWhy I killed Gandhi?\u201d is being released this month on OTT platform, which is based on the life of Nathuram Godse who had killed Mahatma Gandhi.However, the bigger controversy in the issue is the character of Nathuram Godse, which is being played by Dr Amol Kolhe, an actor and MP from the NCP. Kolhe is being opposed both inside and outside of his party.The extent of the controversy could be gauged from the fact that Kolhe\u2019s party leader and Maharashtra minister Jitendra Awhad has openly opposed playing such roles.Amol is an actor by profession and had played the role of Chatrapati Shivaji in Marathi TV show Raja Shiv Chatrapati. The role in the serial was very popular. His role of Chatrapati Sambhaji in Swaraj Rakshak Sambhaji had made him popular.Fighting Goa Assembly Polls Was Never Cakewalk for Shiv Sena, NCP, Shows DataWar of Words Between Devendra Fadnavis, NCP Leaders as Sharad Pawar Plans Goa ForayKolhe was also a star campaigner of Shiv Sena in 2014. He had played Godse in \u201cWhy I killed Gandhi?\u201d while being associated with the ideology of the party. Amol Kolhe played the role of Godse when he was associated with Shivsena in 2019 but he had joined the NCP before the Lok Sabha elections 2019.NCP gave him a ticket from Shirur Lok Sabha seat, where he surprised everyone by defeating Shiv Sena stalwart Shivaji Rao Adhalrao in the election. Kolhe, who has been an MP from NCP, is facing wrath due to the controversy around the ideology.Senior leader of NCP and Maharashtra minister Jitendra Awhad has openly opposed the movie. \u201cIt is clear from the trailer of Amol Kolhe\u2019s movie that he has played the role of Nathuram Godse. Even though he did this role as an artist, Nathuram\u2019s support is associated with it. You can\u2019t support Gandhi\u2019s assassination wearing the cover of an artist. Even Vinay Aapte and Sharad Ponkshe had faced a huge protest against playing this role. Due to this reason, I will oppose the movie which is going against Gandhi,\u201d Awhad said.Although NCP has cleared its stand after the protest, party chief Sharad Panwar has said that Amol Kolhe had accepted that role being an artist. He added, \u201cEven Gandhi movie has also become very popular.\u201d The person who had played the role of Godse in the movie was also an artist.\u201dKolhe responded to the controversy and said that it is a normal to have an ideological consensus or disagreement while playing a role. \u201cI worked in this movie in the year of 2017. Now, it is being released and a lot has happened during this period. I have never glorified Nathuram Godse. But some artists had to do this role. So, I accepted the role. I have all freedom to express my thoughts being a citizen as well as freedom of expression in the capacity of an actor,\u201d he said.Congress is also protesting against the movie. State congress president Nana Patole has said that along with being an artist, Amol Kolhe is also an MP. \u201cA responsible behaviour is expected from him. It is not justified to misuse the freedom which he has got being an artist,\u201d Patole said.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here."}

{"text": "The Indian women\u2019s football team will play their second match of the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup 2022 campaign against Chinese Taipei on Sunday, January 23 at 7.30pm at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai. Ahead of India\u2019s match, the other game from their group between Iran and China will take place at 3.30pm at the Mumbai Football Arena.India started the tournament with a goalless draw against Iran in a match that saw them create 13 chances, have seven shots on target but none could find the back of the net.It was a frustrating night for India, who dominated the match throughout barring the first 20 odd minutes when Iran took the game to India and got off the blocks with intensity.The match was expected to be one of attack vs defence. While that wasn\u2019t the case early on as Iran pressed high and retrieved a lot of balls from India, for the rest of the match Iran defended resolutely while India attacked and attacked.AFC Women's Asian Cup: India's Match vs Chinese Taipei Cancelled, Fans Raise Question on TwitterAFC Women's Asian Cup 2022: India vs Chinese Taipei Called-off Due to Covid-19 OutbreakWhile India dribbled, ran up the pitch and attacked a lot, there was a lack of combination play from the hosts and the players were not playing in between the lines enough.India could not surprise Iran much, allowing the middle-eastern nation to make 82 interceptions in 90 minutes.As India face Chinese Taipei, they are in a must-win situation as they need these three points to give themselves a good chance to make the quarter-finals.India played against Chinese Taipei in one of the friendlies under coach Thomas Dennerby last year and came out 1-0 victors. Renu was the sole goalscorer in that game.18 members of the Chinese Taipei squad during that friendly have come for the Asian Cup, which means there is bound to be a great level of familiarity for both the teams.When China played Chinese Taipei in the tournament opener, they put a lot of crosses from the flanks in the middle to trouble the Taipei central defenders. That is a strategy that India can use, only the hosts will have to make those runs in the middle and provide more options in the box, something they failed to do against Iran.Chinese Taipei cannot be taken lightly even though they looked weak in their first game. Against China, they were not allowed the luxury to circulate the ball and make any inroads. The Indian defence, however, will have to careful and keep compactness at the back.Iran had targetted India\u2019s full-backs in those first 20 minutes and their striker Zandi made a number of numbers either in between the centre-backs or behind Manisa Panna.Chinese Taipei can take cues from that and it might do Dennerby good to cover his bases in those positions. Sanju is a makeshift left-back and was found fluffing her lines quite a bit in the opener.India\u2019s attackers were quite isolated against Iran. In the first half when Manisha Kalyan was trying to force the issue, she didn\u2019t get much support up front. In the second half when Dangmei Grace was troubling the Iran, she didn\u2019t get too many options as well. That is an issue Dennerby will need to address.Pyari Xaxa was the striker in the match and barring a couple of occasions, she lacked the understanding to make runs in the channels to put India in advantageous positions.The match against Chinese Taipei can turn out to be quite tactical and it will all come out down to who can use the spaces better.INDIADangmei Grace - Grace was electric since coming on as a substitute in the second half and her dribbles and pace put the Iranians under a lot of pressure. If she can be more clinical in front of the goal, it will put India in good stead.Indumathi Kathiresan - She was an absolute workhorse for India in the first game and had the tactical intelligence to push forward and create numerical and space advantage for India up front. It will be very important for Indian forwards to combine with her to create chances.CHINESE TAIPEIHsu Yi-Yun -\u00a0The most experienced member of the squad, she has 40 national caps to her name.Lai Li-Chin - The captain for their tournament opener, she has scored eight goals in the 20 games she has played for the country.This is another match where India will need to be on the attack. Dennerby went with a 4-3-3 in their first game against Iran and it is likely that he will use the same formation against.However, there may be a couple of changes in the starting XI.India\u2019s predicted starting XI: Aditi Chauhan (GK), Dalima Chhibber, Ashalata Devi, Manisa Panna, Sanju Yadav; Anju Tamang, Indumathi Kathiresan, Kamala Devi; Dangmei Grace, Manisha Kalyan, Pyari Xaxa.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here."}

It found the centre-back on the far-post, and all Fox had to do was get his head on the ball to score his first goal of the season. Thanks to the goal, the Gaurs went into the halftime break with a slender advantage.The second half saw BFC start purposefully but the Gaurs were resolute in defence and kept their attackers silent. Cleiton Silva came close to scoring the equaliser with a volley moments before the hour mark but his attempt went narrowly past the right side of the goal. However, it took a moment of brilliance from Sunil Chhetri who finally found the back of the net this season to bring the game level. He scored with a sublime header from Prince Ibara\u2019s cross.Two more BFC players in Roshan and Prince received yellows in the second half for mistimed challenges. Brandon Fernandes also made his first appearance of the campaign for FCG from the bench. Chhetri came close to scoring the winner deep into added time after his left-footed curling shot hit the crossbar. There was nothing to separate the sides at the final whistle and the points were shared as a result.Bengaluru FC is up against Chennaiyin FC in their next at the Athletic Stadium on Wednesday whereas FC Goa will clash with Owen Coyle\u2019s Jamshedpur FC at the same venue on Friday.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here."}

The new supercomputer was announced by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who said that it will be completed later this year. \u201cMeta has developed what we believe is the world\u2019s fastest AI supercomputer. We\u2019re calling it RSC or AI Research SuperCluster and it\u2019ll be complete later this year,\" Zuckerberg said in a statement.The supercomputer reflects the heavy investments big tech companies are making in AI research. Other tech companies like Microsoft and Nvidia have also announced their own \u201cAI supercomputers.\" These are slightly different from normal supercomputers, reports have suggested. The AI Research SuperCluster from Meta will be used to train a range of system\u2019s across the company\u2019s businesses.

While noting that the voting percentage rose from 45 per cent in the first Lok Sabha polls in 1951-52 to 67 per cent in 2019, he said the rise in woman voters participation was a good thing, but added that everyone from citizens to members of different political parties should think over low polling.It is seen that urban areas, which are considered educated and prosperous, have low polling, he said, lamenting that their residents discuss elections on social media but don't go to vote.

The audio interaction was earlier meant only for Gujarat BJP workers but was later expanded to include party members from different parts of the country. Modi has often pushed for holding elections, from that of Lok Sabha, to state assemblies and local bodies, simultaneously, saying frequent polls hamper development works and make people impute political motives every step of a government.On the National Voters' Day, held to mark the Election Commission's foundation in 1950, Modi praised the poll watchdog and noted it enjoys wide support from different political parties and institution. The EC also enjoys powers like issuing notices and transferring officers, that its counterparts in other democracies do not, he said, noting that the makers of the Constitution knew that a lively democracy was possible only when there is a strong and unbiased electoral process.In his address, Modi also urged BJP workers to run campaign with people's participation against malnutrition so that a healthy India emerges by 2047, the centenary year of its independence.

{"text": "DETROIT:  Tesla Inc. on Wednesday posted record fourth-quarter and full-year earnings as deliveries of its electric vehicles soared despite a global shortage of computer chips that has slowed the entire auto industry.Although the company predicted it would be able to build 50% more vehicles than it made last year, CEO Elon Musk said the chip shortage would stop the company from rolling out any new models in 2022. That means another delay for the Cybertruck pickup, which was originally scheduled to go on sale last year.Musk also said Tesla isn\u2019t yet working on a promised $25,000 small electric car, but it will.We have enough on our plate right now, quite frankly, he said.And Musk said the company is looking at building additional factories and will offer an update on locations later in the year.The Austin, Texas, company made $5.5 billion last year compared with the previous record year of $3.47 billion in net income posted in 2020. Musk said the annual profit pushed the company\u2019s accumulated earnings since its 2003 inception into profitable territory.Last year was a breakthrough year for the company, Musk said on a conference call with analysts.There should no longer be doubt about the viability and profitability of electric vehicles, Tesla said in a letter to shareholders.Musk said factory output was constrained last year as the company focused resources on modifying vehicles and manufacturing to deal with the chip shortage and other supply-chain problems that will persist this year. A lot of engineering work and factory tooling are under way to produce the delayed Cybertruck, Semi and a new Roadster, which he said he now hopes to be ready for production next year.If were to Tesla start building new vehicles this year, fewer vehicles would be delivered as attention and resources go to the new model, he said.Tesla said it started building Model Y SUVs late last year at its new factory near Austin with more advanced battery cells. After final certification, it plans to start delivering them to customers. The company said its testing equipment at its new factory in Germany, and is still trying to get a manufacturing permit from local authorities.The company said that its \u201cFull Self-Driving software is now being tested on public roads by owners in nearly 60,000 vehicles in the U.S. It was only about 2,000 in the third quarter. The software, which costs $12,000 and cannot yet drive itself, should accelerate Teslas profitability, the company said.Musk said he\u2019d be shocked if the software can\u2019t drive more safely than humans this year, although he dodged a question about whether the company would reach full autonomy in 2022. Currently Tesla says Full Self-Driving is a driver-assist system and drivers must be ready to intervene at all times.In 2019, Musk predicted a fleet of autonomous Tesla robotaxis on the roads by the end of 2020.U.S. safety regulators are looking into a complaint about the safety of Full Self-Driving, and they also are investigating why Teslas operating on a less sophisticated partially automated system called Autopilot have repeatedly crashed into parked emergency vehicles.In the fourth quarter, Tesla made $2.32 billion. Excluding special items such as stock-based compensation, the company made $2.54 per share. That beat Wall Street expectations of $2.36 per share. Revenue for the quarter was $17.72 billion, also ahead of analysts estimates of $17.13 billion, according to FactSet.Tesla delivered a record 936,000 vehicles last year, nearly double the 2020 figure. Fourth-quarter vehicle sales hit 308,600, also a record. Tesla said it expects 50% annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon.It also said Musk was awarded $245 million in the fourth quarter because he reached some operational milestones in his compensation package.The company said it was able to drive cost reductions in the final quarter of the year, as well as grow vehicle sales. But it faced rising raw-material, commodity and logistics costs as well as increased warranty and recall expenses.Tesla\u2019s shares initially tumbled in extended trading after the earnings were announced but then recovered and were down less than 1%. The stock closed Wednesday up 2% to $937.41.Disclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editorRead all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here."}

An ultra-cagey last-16 match produced minimal excitement for the crowd with both teams managing just one shot on target in 120 minutes. Equatorial Guinea now face Sadio Mane-inspired Senegal, one of the title favourites, in Yaounde on Sunday for a place in the semi-finals of the flagship African tournament.It was the second 0-0 draw on Wednesday with Egypt defeating the Ivory Coast 5-4 on penalties in Douala just before the Limbe match kicked off.The players and match officials wore black armbands and observed a moment of silence before the kick-off in memory of the eight people who died in a stampede on Monday before Cameroon beat Comoros in Yaounde.Mali had two Premier League players available and Brighton midfielder Yves Bissouma started while Southampton winger Moussa Djenepo sat on the bench and was introduced after 70 minutes.At Least 20 Dead, 600 Injured in Equatorial Guinea Military Camp ExplosionsFlames Engulf Century-old Historic Cathedral in Equatorial GuineaIbrahima Kone, who scored three of the four Mali goals in the group stage, fired just wide on seven minutes at the 20,000-seat Stade Omnisport, which overlooks the Gulf of Guinea.Equatorial Guinea had a penalty appeal rejected after the referee checked the VAR monitor as a foul-riddled first half progressed.The Equatoguineans were overly physical and Ivan Edu and Jose Miranda were yellow-carded before Mali wasted a half chance to end the deadlock.A free-kick fell favourably for Amadou Haidara inside the box, but his timid shot was comfortably saved by Jesus Owono.Veteran Mali coach Mohamed Magassouba looked on anxiously when Kone was injured, but the Norway-based forward was able to continue after lengthy treatment.It was then the turn of Mali to appeal for a penalty when Moussa Doumbia fell as half-time approached, but the referee changed his decision to initially award a spot-kick after reviewing the incident.A goalless opening half ended with a third yellow card to an Equatoguinean with Pablo Ganet the offender. His team committed 15 fouls during the half, but failed to get a single shot on target.The best scoring chance so far came on 58 minutes when the perseverance of Bissouma set up Haidara, but he blazed over from close range.As the match entered the final quarter of regular time, Mali continued to dominate possession, pass more accurately and concede far fewer fouls, but Equatorial Guinea held firm under pressure.Djenepo enlivened the Mali attack, but could not force a breakthrough and after 95 goalless minutes, the final last-16 match went to extra time.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here."}

{"text": "Lung abnormalities have been discovered in long COVID patients suffering from breathlessness, according to a study that raises the possibility that coronavirus may cause hidden damage to the lungs that is not detected with routine tests. Researchers used a novel xenon gas scan method to pick up lung abnormalities in coronavirus patients who have not been hospitalised but still experience breathlessness.Breathlessness is a symptom in most long COVID patients, but it has been unclear whether this is linked to other factors such as changes in breathing patterns, tiredness, or something more fundamental. The Explain study, a pilot study involving 36 patients, suggests there is significantly impaired gas transfer in the lungs to the bloodstream in long COVID patients \u2013 despite other tests including CT scans coming back normal.\u201cWe knew from our post-hospital COVID study that xenon could detect abnormalities when the CT scan and other lung function tests are normal. What we\u2019ve found now is that, even though their CT scans are normal, the xenon MRI scans have detected similar abnormalities in patients with long COVID, said Fergus Gleeson, the study\u2019s chief investigator. \u201cThese patients have never been in hospital and did not have an acute severe illness when they had their COVID-19 infection. Some of them have been experiencing their symptoms for a year after contracting COVID-19, said Gleeson, who is also a professor of radiology at the University of Oxford and consultant radiologist at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.The professor said there were important questions to answer such as how many patients with long COVID will have abnormal scans, the significance of the abnormality that has been detected, the cause of the abnormality, and its longer-term consequences. Once we understand the mechanisms driving these symptoms, we will be better placed to develop more effective treatments, Gleeson said.At 33, Gujarat Sees Sharp Rise in Daily Covid-19 Deaths, Cases Fall Below 12,000 for First Time in 2 WeeksCovid-19 Third Wave Seems to Be Declining in Maharashtra: Health Minister Rajesh TopeThe study, which involves teams from Sheffield, Oxford, Cardiff and Manchester, had 36 participants split into three groups. The full study will recruit around 400 participants. Emily Fraser, Respiratory Consultant who leads the Oxford Post-COVID Assessment Clinic, said these are interesting results and may indicate that the changes observed within the lungs of some patients with long COVID-19 contribute to breathlessness.However, these are early findings and further work to understand the clinical significance is key. Extending this study to larger numbers of patients and looking at control groups who have recovered from COVID should help us to answer this question and further our understanding of the mechanisms that drive long Covid, Fraser said. Professor Jim Wild, head of imaging and professor at the University of Sheffield, said Xenon MRI was uniquely placed to help understand why breathlessness persists in some patients post COVID-19 infection.Xenon follows the pathway of oxygen when it is taken up by the lungs and can tell us where the abnormality lies between the airways, gas exchange membranes and capillaries in the lungs. This multicentre study is very exciting, and I really look forward to it helping translate lung MRI methods that we have developed further towards clinical use in the UK, Wild said.More than a million people in the UK continue to experience symptoms months after having COVID-19, with breathlessness one of the most commonly reported symptoms. This early research is an important example of both the committed effort the UK research community is taking to understand this new phenomenon, and the world-leading expertise that community contains, said Professor Nick Lemoine, Chair of NIHR\u2019s Long Covid funding committee and Medical Director of the NIHR Clinical Research Network. The study received government funding and is being supported by the National Institute for Health Research\u2019s (NIHR) Oxford Biomedical Research Centre.

And Apple\u2019s high-end chips are costly, an attraction for the chip makers.This essentially means Apple has an advantage and can procure components relatively faster than rivals.Still, while Apple got better service for more sophisticated chips, like many others, it faced troubles with some of the older technology chips, Daiwa Capital Markets analyst Lou Miscioscia said.Chips used in Apple iPads, which saw a 14% drop in revenue, use chips with older technology, and supplies of those older chips were particularly tight, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told analysts.Cook said the constraints on the older chips, or nodes, were very significant in the holiday quarter. \u201cOverall, we do see an improvement in the March quarter in terms of the constraints going down versus what they were in the December quarter,\" he said.Tesla CEO Elon Musk this week said supply chain woes would limit manufacturing output in all company factories. \u201cSo the chip shortage, while better than last year, is still an issue,\" he told analysts.Semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research noted new supply challenges, with the Omicron surge adding more disruption to freight and logistics operations. The company said it was seeing scarcity of certain components and parts, including semiconductors, a few weeks into 2022.Analysts and market leaders in the semiconductor space held out hopes that supply issues would ease later this year.\u201cThat\u2019s going to remain a concern for the industry, but Apple may be the exception to the rule,\" said Romeo Alvarez, technology analyst at William O\u2019Neil + Co.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here."}

He is believed to be in the custody of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network.Threatening the safety of Americans or any innocent civilians is always unacceptable, and hostage-taking is an act of particular cruelty and cowardice, President Joe Biden said in a statement to mark the second anniversary of the kidnapping on Monday. The Taliban must immediately release Mark before it can expect any consideration of its aspirations for legitimacy. This is not negotiable.The statement came as Afghanistan faces a thorny humanitarian crisis following the U.S. withdrawal in August.

Chloe Tyron and Tazmin Brits gave them a scare, with 15 runs coming off the first four balls in the run chase in the Super Over, but Matthews pulled things back to ease Windies to a win.Reduced to 137/8 in a run chase of 161 after Ayabonga Khaka\u2019s maiden ODI five-wicket haul, West Indies seemed down and out until Chedean Nation pulled the run chase together with her composure. With Shakera Salman giving company, West Indies came close to pulling off a win in normal time until South Africa struck again.Masabata Klaas made the all-important breakthrough when she had Nation caught off her bowling in the 37th over. The No.10 and No.11 helped West Indies draw level, but the experienced Ismail kept South Africa in the game by trapping Salman in front for the visitors to be bowled out for 160, the exact same score the hosts managed to put up.India vs West Indies 2022:\u00a0No Fans Allowed For ODI Series in\u00a0Ahmedabad'I Ain't Seen a Boy Sulk: Jason Holder Pleased With Team Performance After T20I Series WinWest Indies began the run chase of 161 with Dottin continuing her amazing form. The opener raced to 37 in 31 balls to give West Indies a quick start, but South Africa managed breakthroughs from the other end. After Khaka got through Dottin and Matthews, Luus struck to remove Stafanie Taylor and Shemaine Campbelle in the same over to leave West Indies in trouble.However, Henry and Nation put on a half-century stand to bring West Indies back before Khaka removed Henry and put South Africa on top again. Eventually, it needed a defiant knock from Nation to bring West Indies level.Earlier in the game, Brits and Laura Wolvaardt put on a half-century opening stand for South Africa after the delayed start saw the match reduced to 41 overs-a-side. By the eighth over West Indies had brought on spinner Hayley Matthews, and the pressure she applied from her end with tight lines brought the first wicket.Wolvaardt was dismissed for 25, breaking the 53-run opening stand, and it opened the floodgates for the Windies. Lara Goodall and Brits followed in the next two overs with Karishma Ramharack striking in her first over with Goodall\u2019s wicket and Henry adding another in her next over, sending back the other opener.At 58/3, the platform South Africa had built early on was already in tatters, but Mignon du Preez and skipper Luus rebuilt with the latter dominating the attack. While du Preez was gone after a brief resistance, out caught by Matthews off Ramharack\u2019s bowling, Luus continued to plunder runs with boundaries flowing off her bat.Alongside Tyron, South Africa resurrected quickly, but Luus fell four runs short of a deserved half-century and Tyron fell four overs later, leaving the Proteas six down with 142 on the board and less than six overs to go. They were bowled out for 160 with two more balls left in the innings, which proved almost enough but not quite.Get all the IPL news and Cricket Score here"}

{"text": "PEBBLE BEACH, Calif.:  Patrick Cantlay was 12 when his father first brought him to Pebble Beach, and it remains one of his favorite golf courses in the world.Every time I\u2019m here I feel lucky, and no different this week, he said.Jordan Spieth feels the same way. He has never missed the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-am, two of those years before he had an endorsement deal with the Dallas-based title sponsor.Arguably the most beautiful place in the United States, especially for a golf lover it\u2019s got to be a No. 1 spot, Spieth said. And then when we get the forecast that we have this week, it just amplifies how amazing it is to play these golf courses.The tournament must be all too happy they feel that way.Cantlay and Spieth are looked upon to provide the limited star quality  at least among PGA Tour players, not so much the amateurs  with so many other big names taking exorbitant appearance money to play in Saudi Arabia.Pebble Beach is among the few PGA Tour events where the course is the biggest star. Even so, the lack of top-ranked players  four of the top 25, nine of the top 50  is hard to ignore.The tournament lost another top-50 player when Will Zalatoris, the PGA Tour rookie of the year during a season that featured a runner-up finish at the Masters, had to withdraw because of a positive COVID-19 test. He was coming off a playoff loss last week at Torrey Pines.Missing is Dustin Johnson, a two-time winner at Pebble, and Phil Mickelson, a five-time winner, most recently three years ago. They are part of a Saudi International field that also includes Paul Casey, Bryson DeChambeau, Xander Schauffele and Patrick Reed.The PGA Tour agreed to grant conflicting event releases provided they play Pebble Beach at least once over the next three years.Cantlay said the allure of money from Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund for appearance money is tempting. He described the attempt at creating a rival super league as complicated.I think with the amount of money they\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s always very tempting. I think it\u2019s tempting for everybody. And to deny that would be maybe not true,\" Cantlay said. But I\u2019m really glad that I\u2019m here this week and I love Pebble Beach. And so that definitely factored into my decision.Daniel Berger is the defending champion, hitting a 3-wood into the par-5 18th that secured the win, and it was even greater theater for him to make the eagle putt for the two-shot margin. That sparked him to a big year that ended with his debut in the Ryder Cup, where he went 2-1 and got even more attention for chugging a beer on the first tee.Spieth won at Pebble Beach in 2017, and even when he wasn\u2019t on his game, he seemed to get a spark on the peninsula.What to expect this year? Good weather, sure. Spieth, however, is coming off a stomach virus that led to him missing the cut for the first time in a year at Torrey Pines.It started with a sinus infection, and the antibiotics tore up his stomach, which he said led to him getting an intestinal infection that can cause severe diarrhea and make it uncomfortable to play tournament golf. It wasn\u2019t a good walk soiled, but close.The last three holes of the first round I was just trying to get in the house, and then pretty much the whole second round was a tough go for me, Spieth said.He was diagnosed with Clostridium difficile, a form of colitis. Spieth said he is feeling better and expects to be at full strength by the opening round Thursday.Spieth will have part of the old gang back together. He is playing with country singer Jake Owen, as always. They typically play with Johnson and Wayne Gretzky, and there is no shortage of entertainment over three days on three courses.Newcomers to the sports and celebrity side of the Pebble Beach Pro-Am are Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen and Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts, along with retired soccer star Mia Hamm.There will be plenty of laughs during some long days, and scenery that is among the best in the world. The amateurs were left out a year ago because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and only two tournaments  Pebble and Spyglass  were in the rotation.Now it\u2019s back to normal, minus a number of players who are 8,000 miles away in Saudi Arabia.___More AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editorRead all the Latest News, Breaking News and Assembly Elections updates here."}

{"text": "In India, accidents and vehicle crash with serious and often fatal outcomes are not uncommon. However, it is not every day that crash survivors come forward to praise the build quality of their vehicles. But when they do, you know for sure that the vehicle did its best at keeping its passengers safe. A Kia Seltos met with an accident recently and thankfully, none of the four occupants were harmed.Among the most successful SUVs right now, the driving dynamics, looks and features of the Kia Seltos have been most impressive. However, while the Australian Kia Seltos received a complete 5-star rating in ASEAN NCAP tests, the Indian variant has been able to secure only a 3-star rating at Global NCAP tests. While this has raised concerns about the kind of safety that can be expected from the Indian version, Rabil Choudhary, the owner of the Kia Seltos involved in the crash mentioned above, can totally vouch for its safety.According to a post made by Rabil, he was driving late at night with three of his friends in his vehicle when a massive truck turned right as it was being overrun, reported CarBlogIndia. Choudhary drove right to avoid a collision, but he lost control of the vehicle. His automobile then flipped twice and came to a stop on the opposite side of the road and luckily did not get hit by any incoming vehicle. The Seltos was severely damaged in the rollover, but the key thing to note is that all of the people were unharmed. All of the occupants came out of the mangled car without any major injuries. The accident took place at about 2:25 AM. Rabil thanked Kia for the build quality of the Seltos and said that he would award a 5-star rating to the vehicle for the protection he received from the accident.Also Watch:Kia India Crosses 1 Lakh Export Milestone in Under 2.5 YearsKia Seltos Rams Into Buffalo at 90 Kmph, Passenger Escapes Without ScratchWhile Rabil and his friends had a narrow escape, one can never guarantee safety in such cases.

{"text": "(This February 4 story deletes incorrect description of Boko Haram as an affiliate of Al Qaeda in paragraph 14; corrects number of Islamic State affiliates in West and Central Africa in paragraph 15; relationship between Islamic State West Africa Province and Islamic State in the Greater Sahara in paragraph 17; and the name of Islamic State\u2019s Central Africa branch in paragraph 21)Since the peak of its power seven years ago, when it ruled millions of people in the Middle East and struck fear across the world with deadly bombings and shootings, Islamic State has slipped back into the shadows.Its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria folded under a sustained military campaign by a U.S.-led coalition, and it has suffered other setbacks in the Middle East.This week it lost its second leader in two years when Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Quraishi detonated explosives during a U.S. military raid in northwest Syria, killing himself and family members.But Islamic State expanded in Africa\u2019s Sahel region last year and the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan may open up opportunities to strengthen its presence there.In the core area of its insurgency, Iraq and Syria, it claimed hundreds of attacks last year. In January it launched an attempted jail-break in northeast Syria in which more than 100 prison guards and security forces were killed.Here is a summary of the group\u2019s presence around the world.MIDDLE EASTIraq, where the group originated, and neighbouring Syria remain the epicentre of Islamic State operations.Once based in the Syrian city of Raqqa and Iraqi city of Mosul, from which it sought to rule like a centralised government, Islamic State now takes refuge in the hinterlands of the two fractured countries.Its fighters are scattered in autonomous cells, its leadership is clandestine and its overall size hard to quantify, although the United Nations estimates it at 10,000 fighters in the heartlands.Last month\u2019s attack on the jail in Hasaka holding hundreds of jihadist detainees was its largest operation since the collapse of the caliphate, showing Islamic State can still carry out large-scale and lethal operations.While links between the leadership and offshoots in other countries may be tenuous, groups from Sinai to Somalia pledged allegiance to Quraishi when he succeeded Islamic State\u2019s founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in late 2019.A United Nations report last year estimated that in Egypt\u2019s Sinai province there may be between 800 to 1,200 fighters loyal to Islamic State.In Libya, where it once held a strip of territory on the Mediterranean coast, the group is weaker, but could still exploit the country\u2019s ongoing conflict. In Yemen it has also been in decline.AFRICAGroups affiliated operationally or by name to Islamic State are only a part of the militant threat across Africa. Others include al Qaeda-linked groups like al-Shabaab, which is active East Africa, and Boko Haram in Nigeria.Islamic State has two known branches in the West and Central Africa region, which include multiple affiliates.Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) formally split from Boko Haram in 2016, after a faction pledged allegiance to Islamic State the previous year. GlobalSecurity.org estimated the group had some 3,500 members in 2021.ISWAP operates mostly around the Lake Chad area bordering Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger. It also includes Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), an operationally independent sub-group in the border area between Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso.The publication in March 2019 by Islamic State media of a picture of ISGS fighters under an ISWAP caption appeared to confirm a connection.The Africa Center for Strategic Studies linked 524 violent events to ISGS in 2020, more than double the numbers of 2019, and they resulted in more than 2,000 fatalities across Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso.The ongoing militant threat posed by various groups has been one of the main factors behind a series of military coups in West Africa over the last 18 months.One of the deadliest groups in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the Allied Democratic Forces, has been linked to Islamic State Central Africa Province by the U.S. State Department.Although the extent of the ADF\u2019s links to the movement are murky, the United States attributed the deaths of 849 civilians to the group in 2020.ADF killings surged by almost 50% in 2021, according to figures from the United Nations. More than 1,200 people were killed in such attacks.SOUTH ASIAIslamic State Khorasan (IS-K) - the movement\u2019s chapter in Afghanistan and surrounding areas - has emerged as the principal militant threat in the region since the Taliban took over the country in August last year.Experts say that its main areas of operation are Central and South Asian states, and that it has been led by an \u201cambitious\" though lesser known leader named Shahab al-Muhajir since 2020.IS-K was first formed in 2015 with the blessing of Baghdadi, according to Western think-tanks, and was a formidable adversary to the U.S.-backed government and Taliban insurgents, even as the two fought each other.Without international and U.S.-trained forces to contend with, IS-K activities have grown, stoking fears that Afghanistan could again become a haven for militant groups just as it was when al Qaeda attacked the United States in 2001.\u201cIt\u2019s just about the biggest concern at the moment for everyone, in the region and in the West,\" a senior Western diplomat told Reuters late last year.Moscow has voiced concern about IS-K increasing its footprint in Central Asian states.The group has carried out a number of audacious attacks recently, most notably a complex raid on Afghanistan\u2019s biggest military hospital in November last year that killed at least 25 people and wounded more than 50.That followed a string of bombings by the group, including a suicide attack outside the gates of Kabul airport during a chaotic U.S. evacuation operation that killed close to 200 people, including U.S. military personnel.Figures on IS-K\u2019s strength vary. A committee of the U.N. Security Council put the number of IS-K fighters at between 1,500 and 2,200, but that was just before the fall of Kabul.There have been reports of disaffected Taliban fighters and some Pakistani Taliban members joining IS-K in recent months. A spiralling economic crisis has pushed millions into poverty and left former Afghan Taliban fighters with no employment.There is little to suggest direct material coordination between IS-K and Islamic State in the Middle East, but some claims of attacks carried out in Afghanistan and neighbouring areas are posted on the group\u2019s central information channels.Disclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editorRead all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here."}

Molecular clock estimates place the origin of sponges in the same time-frame as the age of the rocks I worked on, and so it is not surprising to find possible physical evidence of sponges at that time\u201d.She explained that sponges are the most basic animal in the animal tree of life, so it would not be surprising that the earliest animals may have been sponge-like.Turner collected the samples as a student from the ancient reefs and has argued they display complex structures unlike cyanobacteria and algae. She said, \u201cI initially discovered the material accidentally several decades ago while working on my unrelated PhD research.\u201dThe idea \u201cgestated\u201d in her mind, but what finally allowed her to publish was that there \u201chave been a number of recent papers on how sponges get preserved, and that\u2019s the information I needed to support the interpretation of my own strikingly similar but much older material\u201d.According to an accompanying article in Nature, Turner examined her samples, slices of rock, under a microscope and saw \u201cbranching networks of crystalline tubes\u201d which she \u201clater realised\u201d were structures resembling \u201cthe internal scaffolding of modern horny sponges, and line up with the expected decay and fossilisation patterns of spongin, a collagen protein that forms their scaffolding.\u201dThe argument forwarded is that these crystalline tubes seen in the rocks could have formed when the collagen-like skeleton of the 890-million-year-old sponges decayed and fossilised.Despite the adverse low-oxygen environment, the sponges could have survived on oxygen released by photosynthetic cyanobacteria and being nourished by the \u201corganic ooze\u201d these microorganisms generated.As the Nature study appeared, Laurentian University tweeted, \u201cWe should note Dr Turner\u2019s discovery would be the oldest form of animal life discovered on Earth.\u201dThe Nature article also cited scientists questioning the findings and seeking further evidence before arriving at the conclusion these animals, the sponges, existed nearly nine million centuries back.Asked about her confidence in the discovery, she replied the evidence is \u201cvery distinctive to sponges, and does not compare favourably to other possible interpretations such as microbial, algal, or fungal\u201d. While she is \u201creasonably comfortable publishing\u201d the findings, she added her \u201cmain intent\u201d was to \u201cpresent a new type of evidence and a logical interpretation of it, and then open it up to the scientific community for discussions\u201d."}

Prithiviraj Kapoor, then his son Raj Kapoor and later his other son Shashi Kapoor, were conferred with the prestigious award for all that they have done for the entertainment and arts industry in India.But in 1988, when it was Raj Kapoor's turn to receive the award, the President broke an important protocol for the veteran actor-director. Raj Kapoor was unwell when he landed in Delhi on May 2 for the ceremony. He could not breathe properly and had to be given an oxygen mask and cylinder. Dressed in a crisp white suit and joined by his wife Krishna Raj, Raj Kapoor sat with the audience for the ceremony.However, when it was his turn to receive the award, he could not make it to the stage. This was when President Ramaswamy Venkataraman, the eighth President of India, decided to go to Raj himself.Speaking to Filmfare about the incident, his daughter Rima Jain said, \"Somewhere, I believe, Papa ordained his death. He was to be conferred the Dadasaheb Phalke Award on May 2, 1988, in Delhi. He left from Mumbai on April 30. There was a dust storm in Delhi. As soon as the door of the plane opened, he was greeted with a violent gust of wind. Being an asthma patient, it affected his lungs. He attended the function with an oxygen cylinder.

{"text": "With global pressure mounting on Islamabad to push the marauding Taliban to the peace table, Rawalpindi has suggested a meeting between Afghan government leadership apart from President Ashraf Ghani and the Quetta Shura leaders in Pakistan to negotiate a power sharing settlement largely in favour of Sunni Pashtun Islamists.The earlier attempt brokered by Pakistani deep state to hold a meeting between President Ashraf Ghani and Taliban leaders, Mullah Yaqoob and Sirajuddin Haqqani, between July 17-19 failed as the Islamist leaders have no desire to talk to the current head of Afghan government. The July initiative was the brainchild of US Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad and UK Army Chief Nick Carter and the meetings with Taliban leadership were to take under the garb of a state visit of Ashraf Ghani to Pakistan. While Taliban\u2019s ideological leader Haibatullah Akhunzada is based in Karachi, both Yaqoob and Haqqani are handling military operations of the Sunni group from Quetta and Helmand.With Taliban not willing to negotiate with President Ashraf Ghani, name of Prince Mirwais Khan, son of former King Zahir and Chairman of National Committee for Preservation of Afghan Cultural Heritage, is being floated around as a possible interlocutor for the Afghan government. Prince Mirwais is a scholar with western education and lives in Afghanistan. As of now no dates or names of interlocuter on behalf of the Afghan government have been decided.Although Taliban under pressure from ISI are willing to negotiate with Afghan government interlocutor in Pakistan, the conditions for peace forwarded by the Sunni group to Kabul are very steep. According to diplomats based in Kabul, Taliban this week has put forward three conditions to Afghanistan government for peace negotiations. They are:\u00b7 All Taliban prisoners in Afghan jails should be unconditionally freed.\u00b7 The Afghan government should use its good offices to get Taliban delisted as a terrorist group by the UN. Incidentally, the 1267 sanctions committee that designates individuals and entities as supporters of terrorism is headed by India.\u00b7 The Taliban has proposed that President, Defence Minister, Interior Minister, Army Chief and NDS (spy agency) Chief should be from the insurgent group leaving the lame duck position of Prime Minister to the present regime in Kabul.While it is for the US and the Afghan government to decide the leader to replace Ashraf Ghani if it wants a peace settlement, the Taliban conditions appear to be humiliating to the present government as all the power will be in the hands of the Sunni Islamist force. But the present regime in Kabul has binary options left with the Taliban knocking on its door. Either it fights the Taliban and pushes it back or succumb to the peace demands of the Pak backed Islamist group."}

India were 181/6 when the final day\u2019s play commenced, with a lead of 154 runs, and although all three results seemed possible, it looked as if England would take the game away once they restricted the opposition to 209/8 early.However, what followed was the stuff of epic proportions with two of India\u2019s tail-enders \u2013 Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami \u2013 adding an unbeaten 89-run partnership. India declared their second innings on 298/9, setting England 272 to get, a target which proved too much for the home team to overcome.

The rapid rise in Covid-19 patients has forced Sydney\u2019s Westmead and Blacktown hospitals, which service the city\u2019s sprawling western suburbs, to erect tents to screen and swab patients to help manage capacity.Also, Japan suspended the use of 1.63mn doses of Moderna\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine on Thursday, more than a week after the domestic distributor received reports of contaminants in some vials.Both Japan and Moderna said that no safety or efficacy issues had been identified and that the suspension was just a precaution. \u201cModerna confirms having been notified of cases of particulate matter being seen in drug product vials of its Covid-19 vaccine,\u201d Moderna said.The US is projected to see nearly 100,000 more deaths between now and December 1, according to the nation\u2019s most closely watched forecasting model. \u201cBehaviour is really going to determine if, when and how sustainably the current wave subsides,\u201d said Lauren Ancel Meyers, director of the University of Texas Covid-19 Modelling Consortium. \u201cWe cannot stop Delta in its tracks, but we can change our behaviour overnight.\u201dVaccinations in Africa tripled over the past week, though protecting even 10% of the continent by the end of September remains \u201ca very daunting task\u201d, the Africa director of WHO said."}
{"text": "Alia Bhatt has become a bankable star in just nine years. The actor began her journey with Student of the Year, in 2012, and has starred in a number of movies since. Her biggest hits include the Dulhania series, Highway, Raazi and Udta Punjab.However, not many might know that Alia auditioned for Student of the Year by reading lines from her now-boyfriend Ranbir Kapoor's film Wake Up Sid. A clip of her audition was previously released by Dharma Productions.In the video, Alia dressed in a casual black and white ensemble, and read lines from the film. She was reenacting the scene in which Konkana Sensharma and Ranbir meet for the first time at a college party. While she effortlessly recreated the scene, Alia held a rolled-up tissue paper in her hand and sniffed between lines, as though she was having a cold on that particular day.Besides the scene, Alia also danced to Bahara, from Sonam Kapoor and Imran Khan's film I Hate Love Storys. Watch the clip below:Alia wasn't the only one who auditioned for the role. Karan Johar, in an interview with PTI in 2012, revealed that there were 400 other actors who auditioned for her role. \"We screen tested over 400 girls from across Mumbai and other cities. This is when Niranjan Iyengar told me that Mahesh Bhatt's daughter Alia was raring to go and she could just be the right fit for the film. I did her test and was convinced that she had this X factor that could work for the film,\" he said.Also read: Ma Anand Sheela's advice to Priyanka Chopra, Alia Bhatt if they want to play her: 'Move away from scandal'\"The only thing that I had to ask her was to lose weight.

{"text": "Shang-Chi, both the man and the movie, are in a conflict with the past. The Marvel Cinematic Universe\u2019s 25th film \u2014 oh, how the time has flown \u2014 is fiercely reliant on the franchise\u2019s now-foolproof formula, but also quite prepared to get freaky if and when the situation demands. While Shang-Chi, the character, reckons with the villainous ways of his father, director Destin Daniel Cretton\u2019s massively entertaining movie attempts to undo mistakes committed by its own parent, the MCU.It\u2019s a Marvel film for a Gen-Z crowd, ashamed of the more archaic avenues that the franchise has previously walked down, but also willing to engage with and ultimately embrace woke-minded alternatives.Watch the Shang-Chi trailer here:Shakespearean in its themes of family and visually flashy like the wuxia epics of Zhang Yimou, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a welcome return to form for the MCU after the unbearably impersonal Black Widow. The two movies could be case studies for how the same basic structure can be moulded into different stories.In Cretton\u2019s hands, the sort of origin tale we\u2019ve seen spun dozens of times before takes on a freshness that had been missing from the MCU since Black Panther. Besides the Avengers movies, Marvel\u2019s most recent solo offerings \u2014 the two Spider-Man films, Captain Marvel and the contractually-obligated blob of nothingness that was Black Widow \u2014 have been indistinguishable from each other. Shang-Chi, although it treads familiar thematic ground, feels positively radical in both its style and texture.But as critical as it is of cultural appropriation, I\u2019m not it sure adequately earns the right to call certain things out. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the MCU\u2019s first film with an Asian lead, but it is \u2014 and let\u2019s not forget this \u2014 a Disney production filmed in Australia. Nor can I condone the slanderous tone it takes against Iron Man 3, which remains one of the final examples of the Marvel\u2019s more risk-friendly past, and among my favourite things that the studio has ever done.I must skirt around plot details for obvious reasons, especially since the trailers have done a great job at keeping several key developments a secret. For instance, none of the third act insanity has been spoiled at all, and even though it is envelope-pushing not just by MCU standards but also in the context of Shang-Chi, it feels in line with the film\u2019s internal logic.But before that epic showdown, Shang-Chi\u2019s action is a mixture of intense close-combat and fluid, Crouching Tiger-inspired fights \u2014 all courtesy the late stunt coordinator Brad Allan, to whom the film is dedicated. This is all very unusual for the MCU, which has unfortunately been rather unimaginative when it comes to action, having settled for CGI spectacle and generic quick-cutting. And who can ignore the stories of how some sequences in Marvel projects are pre-visualised in computers even before a script has been written?But more than the action in Shang-Chi, it\u2019s the film\u2019s strong emotional centre that took me by surprise. At its core, it\u2019s a film about family and legacy, and the relationship between a grieving father and his two children, who have had wildly different reactions to the abandonment they\u2019ve suffered at his hands.Played by the great Tony Leung, Wenwu is the film\u2019s secret weapon, and easily the best antagonist Marvel has created since Black Panther's Killmonger. Swatting away the franchise\u2019s long-running \u2018villain problem\u2019 \u2014 which is code for when a Marvel movie pits a hero against someone who is simply their evil clone \u2014 Wenwu\u2019s arc in the film, I would argue, is more resonant than even Shang-Chi\u2019s.He is driven not by hate, but by love. There is no better antagonist than one whose journey you can empathise with, and although Wenwu\u2019s actions are often reprehensible, you can always understand (if not agree with) his motivations. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that Cretton, in one of the series\u2019 biggest casting coups, somehow convinced Leung to join the party, and not just for a glorified cameo. A scene in which he sits across the table from his kids and talks to them about what he does for a living is truly excellent.It captures the strained relationship that he has with them. After their mother\u2019s death, Shang-Chi fled to the United States and assumed a new identity \u2014 Shaun \u2014 and his sister Xialing started a fight club in Macau. They\u2019re reunited as adults when they learn that their father is putting together a quest to locate and infiltrate Ta Lo, a mythical land that their mother used to tell them stories about.As both an action star and as a dramatic performer, Simu Liu is a natural; he possesses all the qualities that Marvel looks for while casting its net for leading men and women \u2014 an easy charisma, a strong physical presence, and most importantly, instant relatability. As good as Liu is in his scenes with both his father and his best friend Katy (Awkwafina), the truest indication of his talents comes in a genuinely moving third-act admission by Shang-Chi.Also read: Black Widow movie review: Scarlett Johansson goes out on the worst Marvel film ever; a boring blob of blahMinor quibbles aside \u2014 Awkwafina\u2019s character has no reason to be involved in the plot for as long as she is, and some of the CGI can feel a little gooey \u2014 Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is exactly the sort of refined entertainment that you\u2019d expect from a Hollywood film of this scale.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten RingsDirector - Destin Daniel CrettonCast - Simu Liu, Tony Leung, Awkwafina, Michelle Yeoh, Meng'er ZhangFollow @htshowbiz for moreThe author tweets @RohanNaahar"}

{"text": "The uncertainty caused by the pandemic has worked both ways in Tim David\u2019s life. If the 25-year-old cricketer from Singapore was grounded at home through most of 2020 because of the outbreak, this year has seen him bag his first IPL contract in a remarkable turn of events.\n\nThe T20 power hitter will now be looking to carry his six-hitting form from the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) to the IPL for Royal Challengers Bangalore, becoming the first player from Singapore to feature in the league.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be representing a lot of the associate players and showing that a player not from Test playing nations can do really good things at a higher level of cricket,\u201d David said speaking from St Kitts on the eve of the CPL final, where he is playing for St Lucia Kings.\nNine months, eight tournaments, six geographical locations\u2014that\u2019s what 2021 has been like for the man proudly carrying his tiny \u201cassociate nations\u201d flag to franchise cricket around the world. He may just be the busiest cricketer in the world right now.\nThis has been a bizarre and breathless year for the man who learnt most of his cricket in Perth, but could only go as far as making the Western Australia second team during his time there. David shifted back to play for Singapore instead (his Australian father Rod played for Singapore too). From there, he slowly began to build a reputation as a big hitter. But it\u2019s only this year, after a smashing season for Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League in December and January that his career soared. Immediately after the Big Bash, he got called up to the Pakistan Super League as a last-minute replacement. From there he went to the Netherlands to play club cricket, got called up by Surrey in England to play two T20 games as an injury replacement and ended up being picked for one-dayers as well. Then he got picked at the last minute for The Hundred, where he played in the final and won.\n\u201cA day after the final, I took a plan to play in the CPL,\u201d David said. \u201cThe whole of last year I was sitting at home doing nothing. Then, it all snowballed a bit. The Covid this year opened up a lot of opportunities. It\u2019s been a long time on the road, but I am grateful.\u201d\nMissing players\nUnlikely names like David have been crucial for the IPL\u2019s second half, set to resume September 19 in the UAE, after players from various countries announced their unavailability for the tournament, citing various reasons, including bio-bubble fatigue and clashing dates with other tournaments.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest stars to pull out were England\u2019s Jonny Bairstow, Chris Woakes and Dawid Malan, all players who were part of the England Test squad during India\u2019s recent tour, where the fifth and final match was cancelled on September 10.\n\nThis means Sunrisers Hyderabad will miss their finest opener (Bairstow), Punjab Kings will miss the world\u2019s No 1 ranked T20 batter (Malan) and Delhi Capitals their fearsome fast bowler.\n\n\nThe team worst hit by withdrawals\u2014certainly by volume\u2014is RCB, who will be without Kiwi skipper Kane Richardson, as well as Australians Adam Zampa, Finn Allen and Daniel Sams.\n\nOther stars who will be sorely missed? Pat Cummins for Kolkata Knight Riders and Jhye Richardson for Punjab and Ben Stokes for Rajasthan Royals.\nNo wonder teams have scrambled for replacements. RCB have brought in Sri Lankan spinner Wanindu Hasaranga and pacer Dushmantha Chameera in Zampa and Sams\u2019 place respectively. While rising English all-rounder George Garton, who David played with in Surrey and in The Hundred this year, replaced Richardson. David came in as Allen\u2019s replacement. This is the first IPL for all these players (Chameera has been part of the Rajasthan Royals squad earlier, but has never played a match).\nIn other teams too, most replacement players are IPL newbies\u2014this includes New Zealand keeper Glenn Phillips, who will fill in for Jos Buttler for RR, and who smashed a 46-ball century against West Indies in November last year, the fastest by a Kiwi in T20Is; and Australia\u2019s Nathan Ellis, brought in for Jhye Richardson by Punjab, who is the first cricketer to take a hattrick on T20I debut, which he did in August against Bangladesh.\nDavid\u2019s mission\nDavid is coveted because of his power game. Standing deep in his crease with his high back-lift, he scores at a reckless pace, and often provides the final flourish. His strike rates across recent tournaments read like this \u2013 153 at the Big Bash, 167 at PSL, 136 at T20 Blast, 150 at RLC ODI\u2019s, 250 at the solitary Hundred game, followed by 149 in the CPL (till semis).\n\u201cPower hitting has become a focus for me in the past couple of years,\u201d he said while promoting team sponsors Indibet. \u201cI wasn\u2019t playing much first-class cricket in Australia. So, I looked for a role that would get me to play professional cricket. I bat in the middle-order in T20 cricket and specialize in those skills a little bit. I have been improving with every outing.\n\u201cPlaying for Singapore has also helped me to play spin quite well because we play on a lot of spin- friendly wickets in Asia. That has been a big part of my development,\u201d he added.\nIt\u2019s something RCB will need. The team was in good shape in the first half of the IPL in India which got suspended, winning five matches out of seven.

He may just be the busiest cricketer in the world right now.This has been a bizarre and breathless year for the man who learnt most of his cricket in Perth, but could only go as far as making the Western Australia second team during his time there. David shifted back to play for Singapore instead (his Australian father Rod played for Singapore too). From there, he slowly began to build a reputation as a big hitter. But it\u2019s only this year, after a smashing season for Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League in December and January that his career soared. Immediately after the Big Bash, he got called up to the Pakistan Super League as a last-minute replacement. From there he went to the Netherlands to play club cricket, got called up by Surrey in England to play two T20 games as an injury replacement and ended up being picked for one-dayers as well. Then he got picked at the last minute for The Hundred, where he played in the final and won.\u201cA day after the final, I took a plan to play in the CPL,\u201d David said. \u201cThe whole of last year I was sitting at home doing nothing. Then, it all snowballed a bit. The Covid this year opened up a lot of opportunities. It\u2019s been a long time on the road, but I am grateful.\u201dMissing playersUnlikely names like David have been crucial for the IPL\u2019s second half, set to resume September 19 in the UAE, after players from various countries announced their unavailability for the tournament, citing various reasons, including bio-bubble fatigue and clashing dates with other tournaments.The latest stars to pull out were England\u2019s Jonny Bairstow, Chris Woakes and Dawid Malan, all players who were part of the England Test squad during India\u2019s recent tour, where the fifth and final match was cancelled on September 10.\n\nThis means Sunrisers Hyderabad will miss their finest opener (Bairstow), Punjab Kings will miss the world\u2019s No 1 ranked T20 batter (Malan) and Delhi Capitals their fearsome fast bowler.\n\n\nThe team worst hit by withdrawals\u2014certainly by volume\u2014is RCB, who will be without Kiwi skipper Kane Richardson, as well as Australians Adam Zampa, Finn Allen and Daniel Sams.\n\nOther stars who will be sorely missed? Pat Cummins for Kolkata Knight Riders and Jhye Richardson for Punjab and Ben Stokes for Rajasthan Royals.\nNo wonder teams have scrambled for replacements. RCB have brought in Sri Lankan spinner Wanindu Hasaranga and pacer Dushmantha Chameera in Zampa and Sams\u2019 place respectively. While rising English all-rounder George Garton, who David played with in Surrey and in The Hundred this year, replaced Richardson. David came in as Allen\u2019s replacement. This is the first IPL for all these players (Chameera has been part of the Rajasthan Royals squad earlier, but has never played a match).\nIn other teams too, most replacement players are IPL newbies\u2014this includes New Zealand keeper Glenn Phillips, who will fill in for Jos Buttler for RR, and who smashed a 46-ball century against West Indies in November last year, the fastest by a Kiwi in T20Is; and Australia\u2019s Nathan Ellis, brought in for Jhye Richardson by Punjab, who is the first cricketer to take a hattrick on T20I debut, which he did in August against Bangladesh.\nDavid\u2019s mission\nDavid is coveted because of his power game. Standing deep in his crease with his high back-lift, he scores at a reckless pace, and often provides the final flourish. His strike rates across recent tournaments read like this \u2013 153 at the Big Bash, 167 at PSL, 136 at T20 Blast, 150 at RLC ODI\u2019s, 250 at the solitary Hundred game, followed by 149 in the CPL (till semis).\n\u201cPower hitting has become a focus for me in the past couple of years,\u201d he said while promoting team sponsors Indibet. \u201cI wasn\u2019t playing much first-class cricket in Australia. So, I looked for a role that would get me to play professional cricket. I bat in the middle-order in T20 cricket and specialize in those skills a little bit. I have been improving with every outing.\n\u201cPlaying for Singapore has also helped me to play spin quite well because we play on a lot of spin- friendly wickets in Asia. That has been a big part of my development,\u201d he added.\nIt\u2019s something RCB will need. The team was in good shape in the first half of the IPL in India which got suspended, winning five matches out of seven.

{"text": "Washington is on high alert ahead of a rally in support of the pro-Trump rioters who ransacked the US Capitol on January 6. Compared to that time, the security forces are better prepared to avoid a repeat of the mayhem.The rally is scheduled to take place on Saturday. Sean Gallagher, acting assistant chief for the Capitol Police's uniformed operations, said that authorities are expecting \"a peaceful event this weekend\" but the security apparatus is ready \"to handle anything that occurs\".Since it's a Saturday, members of Congress will not be in the building; many are still on summer recess and won't be back in town until next week.Who is organising the rally?The \"Justice for J6\" rally is being organised by Look Ahead America, a non-profit organisation led by Matt Braynard, who worked as an analyst for the Republican Party.Braynard started the non-profit after he was dismissed by Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, but his fortunes changed after Trump's 2020 loss. He joined an aggrieved group of Trump allies seeking to overturn the election - and in the process reaped recognition, lucrative fees and fundraising windfall.The group is planning to organise similar rallies across the country in the coming weeks. It has appealed to the attendees to show respect to law enforcement officers and refrain from bringing Donald Trump banners.How many protesters are expected to attend the rally?Though there are no exact numbers, the police say that organisers have obtained a permit for 700 protesters. The officers, however, are prepared a larger turnout.\"What we're concerned about, I think more than anything, is the possibility of counter-demonstrators making it to this demonstration and there being violence between those two groups,\" Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger told reporters.What are the security arrangements?A black fence that surrounded the complex for six months after the deadly riot has been put back up for the weekend along with surveillance cameras.The National Guard has 100 officers standing ready to act as a \"physical security task force\" backing up the Capitol Police and local law enforcement if requested.Capitol Police warned in a news conference there had been \"some threats of violence,\" with a counter-rally scheduled to take place nearby.What happened on January 6, 2021?Thousands of Trump's supporters, some associated with ultra-nationalist and white supremacist groups, stormed the US legislature that day in an effort to overturn President Joe Biden's election victory.Around 600 have been charged, including at least 185 accused of assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees and more than 70 indicted for destruction or theft of government property.A rioter was shot dead by police as she tried to breach the Senate. Officials say the mob assaulted 140 officers, with damage to the Capitol complex estimated at $1.5 million."}

{"text": "The Congress in Karnataka on Monday protested against rise in prices of petrol and diesel by riding bicycles as the party continued to criticise the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre and in the state for piling on the burden on common people.\u201cThe prices have increased drastically after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister. Both Central and state BJP governments are looting common man.

Let him reduce excise duty by 50%.

A lot of thought at the moment is on how to introduce it (the Zydus vaccine) in the system,\u201d said a senior government official who asked not to be named.ZyCoV-D, the Zydus vaccine, is likely to be introduced as part of the vaccine programme soon, although an announcement on vaccinating children is awaited. Till Wednesday night, India has vaccinated 236 million people fully, with another 409 million receiving one dose of the vaccine. With 68.7% of the eligible population having received at least one dose, it is likely the demand for first doses will start tapering off. In many western countries, the ceiling is around 80% of the eligible population.\u201cHowever, whenever it happens that the booster dose is recommended by experts of National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation and National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NTAGI/NEGVAC), there is a possibility that it will happen in a phased manner... and those at high risk will be put on the priority list,\u201d the official added.A Covid-19 booster shot is an additional dose of vaccine given so that the protection provided by the original dosage does not fade. The US has approved a booster dose for health workers and others at high risk. Booster shots are controversial because of vaccine inequity \u2014 people in many parts of Africa are yet to receive even one dose of the vaccine \u2014 and because there\u2019s no clear evidence in their favour.\u201cIt does seem too soon to be giving booster shots. We have data from other countries that have different vaccines and infection rates,\u201d said Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of country\u2019s top vaccinologist from Christian Medical College, Vellore."}

The veteran Congress leader blamed Rahul Gandhi directly but did not name the two other leaders, according to news agency ANI. He also said that Rahul Gandhi has no designation within the party but \u2018continues to call the shots'.\u201cIt's not alright at all, there are three people responsible, one of them is Rahul Gandhi who doesn't even hold any designation, and he is calling the shots,\u201d the veteran leader told news agency ANI.Natwar Singh\u2019s public criticism of Rahul Gandhi comes at a time when the party is facing a leadership crisis in Punjab and murmurs of discord are also being heard from Chhattisgarh, states where the party is in power with majority. There were also similar murmurs in Rajasthan, where there are differences between Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot, but no recent developments happened over the past few days.On Wednesday, Kapil Sibal, another veteran Congress leader, echoed similar concerns like Natwar Singh and said that the party lacks a leader. He said that the G-23 group of Congress leaders - a name which represents a group of senior Congress leaders who seek to question the direction Congress is taking - will continue to flag issues and raise questions.The Punjab crisis put the spotlight on Congress as the state saw the removal of Captain Amarinder Singh from the position of chief minister. Singh, a Congress veteran, said that he wishes to leave the party. He also said that he felt \u2018humiliated' by the way he was treated. The Punjab Congress is in an unsettled state due to Navjot Singh Sidhu\u2019s resignation from the post of Punjab Congress chief, a position to which he was elevated only two months earlier. Sidhu also rebelled against former chief minister Amarinder Singh and expressed his disapproval towards his mode of governance.Other senior Congress leaders, however, asked their colleagues to exercise restraint while criticising fellow leaders. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera urged the party leaders not to go public with the internal matters of the party saying that it has the potential to affect the morale of ground-level workers."}

{"text": "Scientists behind COVID-19 vaccines could be in the running to win the Nobel Prize for Medicine even though the pandemic is far from over. Some scientists say it is just a matter of time: If the work that went into developing the vaccines is not recognised when this year's prize is announced on Monday, it will win the award in years to come.More than 4.7 million people have died from COVID-19 since the first cases of the novel coronavirus were registered in 2019, and many countries still live under severe restrictions intended to curb its spread.But COVID-19 vaccines have helped some wealthy states return almost to normality while others are yet to receive vaccine doses in large quantities.Among those seen by other scientists as potential winners of the Nobel Prize for Medicine are Hungarian-born Katalin Kariko and American Drew Weissman for their work on what are known as Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines.The mRNA vaccines developed by Moderna and by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech have revolutionised the fight against the virus. They are quick to produce and highly effective.\"This technique will get the prize sooner or later, of that I am sure,\" said Ali Mirazami, professor at the Department of Laboratory Medicine at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. \"The question is when.\"Traditional vaccines, which introduce a weakened or dead virus to stimulate the body's immune system, can take a decade or more to develop. Moderna's mRNA vaccine went from gene sequencing to the first human injection in 63 days.The mRNA carries messages from the body's DNA to its cells, telling them to make the proteins needed for critical functions, such as coordinating biological processes including digestion or fighting disease.The new vaccines use laboratory-made mRNA to instruct cells to make the coronavirus' spike proteins, which spur the immune system into action without replicating like the actual virus.DECADES OF WORKThe mRNA was discovered in 1961 but it has taken scientists decades to cure the mRNA technique from problems such as instability and causing inflammatory conditions.Developers now hope it can be used to treat both cancer and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) in the future.\"In addition to the fact that they have been shown to generate a very effective immune response, you do not have to tailor the production every time you make a new vaccine,\" said Adam Frederik Sander Bertelsen, Associate Professor at the University of Copenhagen and chief scientific officer at vaccine company Adaptvac.\"It has actually saved countless thousands of people due to its speed and efficiency, so I can well support that.\"Kariko, 66, laid the groundwork for the mRNA vaccines and Weissman, 62, is her long-time collaborator.\"They are the brain behind the mRNA discovery,\" said Mirazami. He added: \"They might be too young, the (Nobel) committee usually wait until the recipients are in their 80s.\"Kariko, with colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania, made a breakthrough by figuring out how to deliver mRNA without kicking the immune system into overdrive.The Nobel Prize was founded by dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel and is awarded for achievements in Medicine, Chemistry, Literature, Peace and Physics. This year's winners are announced between Oct. 4 and 11, starting with Medicine. (Additional reporting by Stine Jacobsen in Copenhagen, editing by Timothy Heritage)"}

Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts in Andhra Pradesh and Ganjam and Gajapati districts in Odisha faced maximum winds due to Gulab while East Godavari, West Godavari, Guntur, Krishna, Prakasam, Srikakulam and Visakhapatnam districts in Andhra Pradesh saw floods. In Odisha, Bhadrak, Kendrapara, Puri, Jajapur, Jagatsinghpur, Baleswar, Khorda and Cuttack also saw flooding, according to RMSI.\u201cThe governments of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh proactively took measures to reduce impact. Odisha\u2019s chief minister Naveen Patnaik set a \u2018zero casualty\u2019 target in the coastal districts of the state as the Odisha government evacuated as many as 3,049 people and shifted them to 204 relief shelters.

Due to heavy rain, standing crop fell. There was a lot of water stagnation because of which other than paddy, all crops, including vegetables which were in flowering stages, are damaged.

{"text": "NEW DELHI: The Centre has decided to defer the National Entrance Eligibility Examination for super speciality courses (NEET-SS) scheduled to be held in November to January 2022 to give postgraduate doctors time to prepare for the new examination pattern.About 41 postgraduate doctors have approached the top court, complaining about they were informed about the change in the examination pattern only on August 31 when the Information Booklet was released by the National Board of Examinations. The examination was notified on July 23.The government\u2019s decision to defer the examination comes a week after the Supreme Court told the Union government not to \u201ctreat doctors like footballs\u201d and asked the government to reconsider its decision on last-minute changes in the entrance examination pattern for super specialty medical courses.In its response filed before the Supreme Court on October 1, the Centre said: \u201cWith the modification of 100% weightage to the questions pertaining only to the feeder course of the broad speciality (MD, MS) where they have already undergone those courses, in the circumstances, it was decided that the NEET-SS be deferred by a period of two months and be held on January 10-11, 2022, so as to provide ample or sufficient time and opportunity to all of them for their preparation for the entrance examination under the revised scheme/pattern.\u201dThe doctors were aggrieved that since 2018, 60% questions were from the super speciality stream that they applied for while the remaining 40% questions came from the broad super speciality courses or feeder course, i.e. MD or MS.The super speciality examinations are conducted for filling more than 4,200 seats in Doctorate of Medicine (DM), Master of Surgery (M.Ch) and Doctorate of National Board (DrNB).This year, the examination had 100% questions from the feeder course, thus placing students who prepared for their respective super speciality stream at a disadvantage.On September 27, the court told the Centre, NBE and National Medical Commission to devise a solution. \u201cDon\u2019t treat these doctors as footballs in this game of power,\u201d the court said, even urging the Centre and NBE to consider conducting the examination this year on the old pattern.The Centre was unwilling to change the examination pattern stating that any change now will affect those students who have prepared as per the revised scheme. Moreover, NBE told the court that the pattern was changed to avoid wastage of precious DM/MCh/DrNB seats that go vacant each year.The Centre said 545 seats remained vacant in 2019, while last year, this number rose to 805.\u201cThe NEET-SS in the revised scheme seeks to assess the candidate\u2019s competence in his/her broad speciality and not in a super speciality that he/she, as yet has no training, whatsoever in\u2026Therefore, the modified scheme has not mandated the applicant candidates to study something different from what they have not studied earlier,\u201d the affidavit stated.So far, the NBE has received 11,911 applicants for NEET-SS and this number is expected to rise to about 18,000."}

However, the boilers are now reach the port in Kerala by month-end, from where they will take nearly 40 more days to reach Delhi by road, the officials said.This will be SDMC\u2019s second waste to energy plant which will process 2,000 tonnes of municipal solid waste per day. The facility will be spread over 15 acres near Tehkhand. \u201cWith the second plant being operationalised next year, we will be able to process 100% of municipal waste generated in the SDMC areas. Currently, only 53% of waste is being processed while the rest ends up at the Okhla landfill,\u201d an official said asking not to be named.The areas under SDMC generate a total of 3,600 tonnes of municipal waste every day.Currently, Delhi has three waste to energy plants in Ghazipur, Narela and Okhla. The three existing plants have an aggregate capacity to process 5,250 tonnes of waste to generate 52MW power.Delhi generates more than 11,144 tonnes of waste. In 2019, the north corporation proposed to build a second plant with 1,500 TPD (tonnes per day) capacity near Bhalswa and EDMC plans to build its second such facility in Ghonda Gujran.\u201cIn a few years, the new engineered landfill sites will receive only the ash and burnt leftover from the waste to energy plant and certain components of waste which cant be incinerated. The Okhla and Tehkhand plant will together generate 400-500 tonnes of such waste which will then be dumped at the new engineered landfill site,\u201d official explained.The general trend in Delhi is now towards using incineration as primary method of waste processing. However, the waste to energy plants have faced stiff resistance by local residents who have flagged pollution generated by such plants.Experts have repeatedly pointed out that Delhi should focus on segregation of household waste instead of setting up waste to energy plants.Defending the move to set up the waste to energy plants, a senior SDMC official said that the waste management models of smaller cities cannot be easily replicated in a city with a population of more than 200 million people. \u201cExisting landfills are saturated. People have been resisting the setting up of new landfill sites in their regions while the household waste segregation levels still remain relatively low. The waste to energy plants generate electricity for the city while also providing a solution for the waste disposal problem,\u201d he added."}

The 50-year old MP appeared before a Judicial Magistrate Court in Panruti, about 25 kilometres from Cuddalore, and he was remanded to judicial custody till Wednesday. Later, he was lodged in a sub-jail in the district.A police officer told PTI that following the outcome of Covid-19 test, which is expected by tomorrow, he would be lodged in the Cuddalore Central Prison. Ramesh would be produced before the Chief Judicial Magistrate court in Panruti on Wednesday, he added.The Lok Sabha MP from Cuddalore has been named in an FIR in the alleged murder of Govindarasu, an employee in his cashew unit off Panruti in Cuddalore district. Already, five men including Ramesh's assistant have been arrested in connection with the worker's alleged murder last month. Police had claimed that they were on the lookout for him while he surrendered today.Ramesh has been booked under various sections of the IPC including murder, wrongful restraint and conspiracy and for causing disappearance of evidence and CB-CID is probing the case.Govindarasu, a PMK office-bearer, had been working in the cashew unit owned by Ramesh in Cuddalore district for the past about seven years. The cashew nut unit management had claimed that \"Govindarasu died by suicide\" and initially police probed it as a \"death under suspicious circumstances\". Later, the case was taken up by the CB-CID and the issue also went to the Madras High Court.PMK founder leader Ramadoss had alleged that if not arrested, Ramesh would tamper with evidence and urged the CB-CID to immediately arrest him. Ahead of his surrender, Ramesh said he would legally prove that the accusation levelled against him was baseless. He said he was anguished about a false propaganda against his party by \"some political parties due to political vendetta,\" which was based on an FIR against him. The MP, in a statement, said he was surrendering before the court so as to not give room to those who wanted to hurl accusations at his party-led regime, steered by DMK president and chief minister MK Stalin, who is providing good governance."}

{"text": "New Delhi: The political slugfest over Chhath puja celebrations has intensified, once again, in the national Capital. While the demand for a public holiday on Chhath and arrangements at the ghats have been at the centre of the political tussle in the past, this time, it\u2019s the ban on its celebrations by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).\n\nThe ban on Chhath puja celebrations \u2014 the biggest event for the Purvanchal community \u2014 gained significance because the municipal elections are scheduled for early next year. The community, with close to four-five million people in the city, plays a decisive role in Delhi\u2019s electoral politics.\nChhath puja, a three-day festival, will be celebrated between November 8-10 this year. It is most popular in states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand (often referred to as Purvanchal), and parts of Madhya Pradesh. \nThe ban, the reaction\nThe DDMA \u2014 headed by lieutenant governor (L-G), Anil Baijal, with Delhi chief minister (CM) Arvind Kejriwal as a member \u2014 prohibited Chhath celebrations, for the second consecutive year, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This, while it allowed Ramlila, Durga Puja, and Dussehra festivities in public places earlier this month.\nThe ban sparked a political row with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with northeast\u2019s Delhi BJP Member of Parliament (MP), Manoj Tiwari, hitting out at Kejriwal for \u201churting the sentiments of the community\u201d. Even Delhi Congress president Anil Kumar condemned the ban, and held a protest outside the CM\u2019s residence recently. \nUnder attack from the Opposition, Kejriwal wrote to the L-G on Thursday, urging him to allow the celebrations. \u201cOther neighbouring states have allowed it with necessary protocols. I request you convene a meeting of the DDMA and consider allowing Chhath Puja in Delhi too,\u201d he said in the letter.\nThe Delhi government also wrote to the Centre asking it to issue necessary directions regarding Chhath Puja celebrations.\nWhile the BJP is claiming it as its victory, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) accused the BJP of politicising the festival for electoral gains, with its eye on the municipal polls next year.\nOn Chhath, the BJP vs AAP\nDespite its second consecutive defeat in the Delhi assembly election in 2020 (it won eight seats out of 70), the BJP has been in power at the municipal level since 2007. It is now working hard to secure a fourth term in the municipal polls, but will face strong anti-incumbency.\nThe support of the Purvanchal community \u2014 once considered a Congress vote bank that later shifted to the AAP \u2014 was instrumental in the BJP\u2019s victory in the municipal polls in 2017, despite anti-incumbency.\nSenior BJP leaders admit that the appointment of Tiwari, who is BJP\u2019s popular Purvanchal face, as Delhi BJP chief, and the decision to field around 27 people from the community played an important role in its 2017 victory. The move marked a shift in the BJP\u2019s strategy (known as a party of Punjabis and Baniyas), and a tacit acknowledgement of the community\u2019s growing strength in the city. The BJP not only won the three civic bodies, but also improved its tally from 138 seats (in 2012) to 181.\nBut this time, Delhi environment minister and senior AAP leader, Gopal Rai, said that the BJP knows it is going to lose. \u201cTheir defeat in Shalimar Bagh [a BJP stronghold] is an indication that people don\u2019t want them. They know that they will not win in the municipal elections, this is why they are politicising the Chhath issue.\u201d\nBut Delhi BJP chief, Adesh Gupta, disagreed and said that their protest is against the Delhi government which neglected the wishes of the community. \u201cThe government has hurt the sentiments of the community by banning the Chhath Puja in public spaces. When other festivals and gatherings are allowed, weekly markets and liquor vends are open, why ban Chhath?\u201d\nThe Congress, which is struggling to stage a comeback in Delhi, has jumped into the controversy. Delhi Congress president Anil Kumar said, \u201cThe permission has been denied on the facile plea that it would spread the Covid-19 infection, though the government didn\u2019t deny permission to hold other festivals.\u201d\nCalling the protests an election gimmick, AAP leader, Rai, asked that if the BJP was serious, why didn\u2019t they meet central government ministers and the L-G to find a solution? \u201cThe DDMA is headed by the L-G. The Centre is yet to clarify the protocols regarding Chhath\u2026. We want people to celebrate Chhath, but it can\u2019t be at the cost of people\u2019s lives. The Centre and the DDMA have to take a call on it,\u201d said Rai.\nSachidanand Sinha, professor at the Centre for the Study of Regional Development, said, \u201cThe government shouldn\u2019t fall prey to any pressure to allow an event if there is any risk to people\u2019s lives. The health of people can\u2019t be sacrificed to allow any gathering. The AAP is not going to lose much if they take a firm stand.\u201d\nThe demand for a public holiday\nThis is not the first time when a political row has erupted over the Chhath puja celebrations.\nIn 2010, when the BJP was the ruling party in the erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi, it raised, for the first time, the demand that Chhath Puja be declared a public holiday. It was not accepted by the then Congress chief, Sheila Dikshit, but the government made elaborate arrangements at the ghats for Chhath Puja celebrations.\nIn 2011, in the run-up to the municipal elections in 2012, the Delhi BJP stepped up its demand. The then Delhi Congress president, JP Agarwal, and even Bihar CM, Nitish Kumar, wrote to Dikshit requesting Chhath puja be declared a public holiday. The Centre declared Chhath a restricted holiday that year.\nThe BJP, which won the 2012 municipal elections despite the trifurcation of the civic body, passed a resolution in three newly-formed civic bodies declaring Chhath puja a public holiday. \u201cSince 2010, we have been demanding Chhath be declared a public holiday. But the government didn\u2019t agree. It was after we passed the resolutions in civic bodies, the Delhi government was compelled to declare it a holiday,\u201d said BJP Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) from Rohini, Vijender Gupta, who was then the Delhi BJP chief.\n\n\n\n\nBJP MP Manoj Tiwari during a march to urge Delhi government to permit Chhath puja celebrations, at the Sonia Vihar ghat in New Delhi, October 9, 2021 (PTI)\n\nLater, in 2018, the BJP, which is the ruling party in three civic bodies, and the AAP-led Delhi government indulged in a blame game over Chhath Puja preparations at the ghats. Last year too, the BJP and AAP sparred over the ban on Chhath celebrations, with Kejriwal asking Opposition parties not to politicise the event.\n\nThe Purvanchal vote bank\nSanjay Kumar, professor and co-director, Lokniti (a research programme of Centre for the Study of Developing Societies) said that Chhath has become a political event in Delhi. Referring to the recent political slugfest in Delhi, Kumar said, \u201cFor political parties, Chhath has become an important political event to mobilise the support of the Purvanchal community, which today constitutes 30-35% of voters in Delhi. The BJP is trying hard to break one of the AAP\u2019s strong vote banks.\u201d\nWhile multiple communities are living in the city, the Purvanchal community has emerged as a dominant force in electoral politics. From having a presence in just a few pockets in west Delhi in the early 1990s, the Purvanchal community today plays a decisive role in 25-30 assembly seats, said several political analysts.\nWith the community having the power to sway electoral fortunes in assembly seats, including Kirari, Burari, Karawal Nagar, Ghonda, Sangam Vihar, Nangloi Jat, Badli, and in parliamentary constituencies such as West Delhi, East Delhi, North East Delhi, North West Delhi, and South Delhi, they are on the radar of all major players.\nFormer Congress MP Mahabal Mishra, the party\u2019s first Purvanchal leader in Delhi, said, \u201cToday, the BJP is raising the Chhath puja issue. But BJP never bothered about the community when they were in power in the 1990s. Today, the community has become politically significant, and winning an election is not possible without their support.\u201d\nFor the longest time, the Congress enjoyed the support of the community, which largely lived in unauthorised colonies and slums. Former Congress MP from northeast Delhi, JP Agarwal said, \u201cThe Congress always got their support as we did a lot of work for people living in these unauthorised colonies and slums. We also gave them representation in electoral politics.\u201d\nBut in 2013, and later in 2015, the AAP was successful in winning the support of the community. The party\u2019s promise of free electricity and water, along with its focus on education and health, paid dividends in 2015, when it won 67 seats in the assembly elections.\nElectoral representation\nRai said that the party gave substantial representation to people from the community, which was not done earlier by any party. \u201cThere were many people from the community who were associated with us before the party was formed. We gave many of them a chance to contest the election,\u201d said Rai.\nIn the 2015 assembly elections, the AAP fielded 11 Purvanchalis, while the BJP and the Congress had fielded just three and two Purvanchalis, respectively. In the 2013 assembly elections, five of the nine Purvanchali candidates fielded by the AAP won.\nKumar said that political parties such as the Congress and the BJP earlier had people who acted as intermediaries between the community and the party. This helped garner the support of the community during elections. But the past few years, especially with the emergence of the AAP, this changed as the community itself was given electoral representation.\n\u201cThe AAP adopted a strategy to give the community representation in electoral politics and it worked in their favour,\u201d said Kumar. \nIn 2012, the BJP too gave tickets to people from the community. \u201cIt was one of the reasons for the party\u2019s victory in municipal polls. The community has a presence on several assembly seats. No political party can ignore them. The BJP did get the support of the community in 2012 and 2017 municipal elections,\u201d said Gupta, who was Delhi BJP chief then.\nThe BJP has been trying to make inroads in the AAP\u2019s strongholds in unauthorised colonies and slums. The party fielded close to 12 candidates from the community in the 2020 assembly polls.\nThe BJP-led central government passed a law and announced the PM-UDAY scheme to give ownership rights to residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies in Delhi just before the assembly elections of 2020. But it didn\u2019t work in its favour, as BJP lost the election.\nKumar said, \u201cWhile the BJP has been able to change its image nationally and gets the support of OBCs [Other Backward Classes], Dalits, Adivasis and so on, it has not been able to do so in Delhi. This is because they have not been able to change the nature of their leadership in Delhi. Though Tiwari was made the chief, it was for a brief period. For the BJP to win the support of the community, there is a need for long term measures.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy unlimited digital access with HT Premium\nSubscribe Now to continue reading\nStart 15 Days Free Trial\n\nAlready Subscribed? \nSign In\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE ONThe ban on Chhath puja celebrations \u2014 the biggest event for the Purvanchal community \u2014 gained significance because the municipal elections are scheduled for early next year.

They know that they will not win in the municipal elections, this is why they are politicising the Chhath issue.\u201dBut Delhi BJP chief, Adesh Gupta, disagreed and said that their protest is against the Delhi government which neglected the wishes of the community. \u201cThe government has hurt the sentiments of the community by banning the Chhath Puja in public spaces. When other festivals and gatherings are allowed, weekly markets and liquor vends are open, why ban Chhath?\u201dThe Congress, which is struggling to stage a comeback in Delhi, has jumped into the controversy. Delhi Congress president Anil Kumar said, \u201cThe permission has been denied on the facile plea that it would spread the Covid-19 infection, though the government didn\u2019t deny permission to hold other festivals.\u201dCalling the protests an election gimmick, AAP leader, Rai, asked that if the BJP was serious, why didn\u2019t they meet central government ministers and the L-G to find a solution? \u201cThe DDMA is headed by the L-G. The Centre is yet to clarify the protocols regarding Chhath\u2026. We want people to celebrate Chhath, but it can\u2019t be at the cost of people\u2019s lives. The Centre and the DDMA have to take a call on it,\u201d said Rai.Sachidanand Sinha, professor at the Centre for the Study of Regional Development, said, \u201cThe government shouldn\u2019t fall prey to any pressure to allow an event if there is any risk to people\u2019s lives. The health of people can\u2019t be sacrificed to allow any gathering. The AAP is not going to lose much if they take a firm stand.\u201dThe demand for a public holidayThis is not the first time when a political row has erupted over the Chhath puja celebrations.In 2010, when the BJP was the ruling party in the erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi, it raised, for the first time, the demand that Chhath Puja be declared a public holiday. It was not accepted by the then Congress chief, Sheila Dikshit, but the government made elaborate arrangements at the ghats for Chhath Puja celebrations.In 2011, in the run-up to the municipal elections in 2012, the Delhi BJP stepped up its demand. The then Delhi Congress president, JP Agarwal, and even Bihar CM, Nitish Kumar, wrote to Dikshit requesting Chhath puja be declared a public holiday. The Centre declared Chhath a restricted holiday that year.The BJP, which won the 2012 municipal elections despite the trifurcation of the civic body, passed a resolution in three newly-formed civic bodies declaring Chhath puja a public holiday. \u201cSince 2010, we have been demanding Chhath be declared a public holiday. But the government didn\u2019t agree. It was after we passed the resolutions in civic bodies, the Delhi government was compelled to declare it a holiday,\u201d said BJP Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) from Rohini, Vijender Gupta, who was then the Delhi BJP chief.Later, in 2018, the BJP, which is the ruling party in three civic bodies, and the AAP-led Delhi government indulged in a blame game over Chhath Puja preparations at the ghats. Last year too, the BJP and AAP sparred over the ban on Chhath celebrations, with Kejriwal asking Opposition parties not to politicise the event.\n\nThe Purvanchal vote bank\nSanjay Kumar, professor and co-director, Lokniti (a research programme of Centre for the Study of Developing Societies) said that Chhath has become a political event in Delhi. Referring to the recent political slugfest in Delhi, Kumar said, \u201cFor political parties, Chhath has become an important political event to mobilise the support of the Purvanchal community, which today constitutes 30-35% of voters in Delhi. The BJP is trying hard to break one of the AAP\u2019s strong vote banks.\u201d\nWhile multiple communities are living in the city, the Purvanchal community has emerged as a dominant force in electoral politics. From having a presence in just a few pockets in west Delhi in the early 1990s, the Purvanchal community today plays a decisive role in 25-30 assembly seats, said several political analysts.\nWith the community having the power to sway electoral fortunes in assembly seats, including Kirari, Burari, Karawal Nagar, Ghonda, Sangam Vihar, Nangloi Jat, Badli, and in parliamentary constituencies such as West Delhi, East Delhi, North East Delhi, North West Delhi, and South Delhi, they are on the radar of all major players.\nFormer Congress MP Mahabal Mishra, the party\u2019s first Purvanchal leader in Delhi, said, \u201cToday, the BJP is raising the Chhath puja issue. But BJP never bothered about the community when they were in power in the 1990s. Today, the community has become politically significant, and winning an election is not possible without their support.\u201d\nFor the longest time, the Congress enjoyed the support of the community, which largely lived in unauthorised colonies and slums. Former Congress MP from northeast Delhi, JP Agarwal said, \u201cThe Congress always got their support as we did a lot of work for people living in these unauthorised colonies and slums. We also gave them representation in electoral politics.\u201d\nBut in 2013, and later in 2015, the AAP was successful in winning the support of the community. The party\u2019s promise of free electricity and water, along with its focus on education and health, paid dividends in 2015, when it won 67 seats in the assembly elections.\nElectoral representation\nRai said that the party gave substantial representation to people from the community, which was not done earlier by any party. \u201cThere were many people from the community who were associated with us before the party was formed. We gave many of them a chance to contest the election,\u201d said Rai.\nIn the 2015 assembly elections, the AAP fielded 11 Purvanchalis, while the BJP and the Congress had fielded just three and two Purvanchalis, respectively. In the 2013 assembly elections, five of the nine Purvanchali candidates fielded by the AAP won.\nKumar said that political parties such as the Congress and the BJP earlier had people who acted as intermediaries between the community and the party. This helped garner the support of the community during elections. But the past few years, especially with the emergence of the AAP, this changed as the community itself was given electoral representation.\n\u201cThe AAP adopted a strategy to give the community representation in electoral politics and it worked in their favour,\u201d said Kumar. \nIn 2012, the BJP too gave tickets to people from the community. \u201cIt was one of the reasons for the party\u2019s victory in municipal polls. The community has a presence on several assembly seats. No political party can ignore them.

The party fielded close to 12 candidates from the community in the 2020 assembly polls.\nThe BJP-led central government passed a law and announced the PM-UDAY scheme to give ownership rights to residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies in Delhi just before the assembly elections of 2020. But it didn\u2019t work in its favour, as BJP lost the election.\nKumar said, \u201cWhile the BJP has been able to change its image nationally and gets the support of OBCs [Other Backward Classes], Dalits, Adivasis and so on, it has not been able to do so in Delhi.

First celebrated as an official festival in Egypt, the celebrations of Eid-e-Milad became more popular during the 11th century.When Is Eid Milad-un-Nabi Being Celebrated?This year, as per the Gregorian calendar, Eid Milad-Un-Nabi will begin on the evening of October 18, 2021, and will end on the evening of October 19, 2021.About Prophet MohammadProphet Muhammad is believed to have been born on the 12th of 573 AD, the third month of Islam, Rabi al-Awwal. Eid-e-Milad is also mourned by some because it is also believed to be the death anniversary of the Prophet. The full name of Prophet Hazrat Mohammad was Mohammad ibn Abdullah ibn Abdul Muttalib. He was born in the city of Mecca. It is believed in 610 AD he attained enlightenment in a cave named Heera near Mecca. He later preached the teachings of the Quran, the holy book of the religion of Islam.The festival of Milad-un-Nabi is celebrated by followers of Islam.

{"text": "The agriculture department has ruled out any role of spurious BT cotton seeds or substandard insecticides behind the widespread infestation of pink bollworm pest on the cotton crop in the south Malwa districts.In a fact-finding report submitted to the state government last weekend, the department has squarely blamed the cotton ginning factories and poor farm practices behind the worst ever pink bollworm pest attack in Punjab.Agriculture minister Randeep Singh Nabha confirmed receiving the report but declined to share its content.\u201cThe detailed report will be tabled in a cabinet meeting scheduled to be held later this week for compensation to affected cotton growers,\u201d said the minister.Officials said Bathinda and Mansa are the worst-hit districts where 80% area under cotton crop has suffered 76-100% damage.Bathinda has the largest area of 96,000 hectares of Punjab under the cash crop whereas cotton was sown on 65,000 hectares in Mansa.BKU (Ekta Ughrahan) has been blaming the poor quality of seeds and insecticides for the pest infestation.BKU (Ekta Ughrahan), which is demanding a compensation of \u20b960,000 per acre, ended the dharna outside finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal\u2019s residence after 15 days on Tuesday and decided to resume the protest outside the Bathinda district administrative complex from October 25.Bathinda chief agriculture officer Manjit Singh said there was no evidence of spurious BT cotton seeds sold to farmers in the region.Field inspections found that cotton ginning units were responsible for breaching safety protocols while processing raw cotton bought from other states, he added.Bathinda has 21 units whereas in Mansa there 14 units engaged in ginning.\u201cThese factories were bringing raw cotton from different states, including from the regions experiencing pink bollworm attack for over six years. As fumigation of factories was not conducted periodically, the pest population grew alarmingly in Bathinda and Mansa in the last four years,\u201d said Singh.An agriculture scientist said pink bollworm is a monophagous pest which survives only on cotton plants. As farmers failed to follow guidelines of cotton crop residue management, it gave ample space for the pest to survive.Pink bollworm attack on BT cotton is nothing new and it was common in other states of Telangana, Karnataka and Maharashtra, said the expert.\u201cIt is a baseless claim that spurious seeds caused the infestation. The deadly pest was in the farm ecosystem of southern Punjab since 2018 when it was detected for the first time in Punjab at Bathinda\u2019s Jodhpur Romana village. Field analysis shows that like ginning units, farmers also did not pay much attention to the repeated advisories against pink bollworm threat in the last three years. Overconfident farmers failed to notice infestation at the initial levels and the pest attack spread even in pockets of Sangrur and Muktsar districts as well,\u201d said an official engaged in field surveillance.Cotton prices cross \u20b98,000 markOwing to high demand in the market and suspected low productivity this kharif season, private players are paying up to \u20b98,300 per quintal, the highest price ever, against the MSP of \u20b95,925.Out of seven cotton-growing districts, the rate of raw cotton has crossed \u20b98,000 mark in mandis of six districts. Till Wednesday, 5 lakh quintal cotton was purchased at various centres of the semi-arid districts of the state.Fazilka is leading with 1.78 lakh quintals, followed by Mansa 1.08 lakh quintals, Bathinda and Mansa 98,000 each."}

{"text": "At least six people were killed and 10 others injured in a violent attack after two groups of Rohingya refugees clashed at a religious school in a Rohingya camp in Ukhiya area of Bangladesh's Cox Bazar, a police official said on Friday. The attackers, carrying guns, killed three teachers, two volunteers and a student in the world's largest refugee settlement.The violence erupted when one of the groups opened fire, killing four people at the scene, Police superintendent Shihab Kaiser Khan said. Two others succumbed to their injuries in the hospital.\"A drive is underway to arrest those responsible for the incident,\" Khan told Reuters. One Rohingya man with weapons and ammunition had been taken into custody, he said.It was unclear as to why the violence broke out, but the local media reported that the two sides clashed over establishing supremacy in the camp over an illegal drug business. A few Rohingya groups are known to be involved in crimes such as kidnapping and ransom-seeking, Bangladeshi officials have said, and they use the refugee camps to smuggle drugs from Myanmar.The attack comes three weeks after the murder of Mohibullah, a key international representative for Rohingya refugees, in the same sub-district of Ukhiya. Several arrests have been made in this case.More than a million Rohingya refugees inhabit in camps in southern Bangladesh, with most having fled neighbouring Myanmar during a military crackdown in 2007.These settlements grew increasingly violent, as per reports, with armed gangs vying for power, kidnapping critics and warning women against breaking conservative Islamic norms."}
{"text": "British health officials on Friday said they were formally looking into a subvariant of the Delta strain of the coronavirus, after it was seen in a growing number of cases.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), a public health protection body, said AY.4.2, which was last week seen in six percent of cases, had been \"designated as a variant under investigation\" but not yet a \"variant of concern\".\"The designation was made on the basis that this sub-lineage has become increasingly common in the UK in recent months, and there is some early evidence that it may have an increased growth rate in the UK compared to Delta,\" the agency said.\"More evidence is needed to know whether this is due to changes in the virus' behaviour or to epidemiological conditions,\" it added.The UKHA said the Delta variant was \"overwhelmingly dominant\" in Britain, accounting for 99.8 percent of all cases.But as of October 20, there have been 15,120 cases of the subvariant AY.4.2, which was first detected in July, as coronavirus restrictions were lifted across the country.\"While evidence is still emerging, so far it does not appear this variant causes more severe disease or renders the vaccines currently deployed any less effective,\" the UKHA added.Britain is currently battling the second-highest infection rate in the world, behind the United States, with more than 50,000 cases recorded on Thursday -- the highest since July.On Friday, nearly 50,000 new cases were added, and 180 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, taking the overall toll since the start of the outbreak to 139,326.High levels of infection among school-age children are said to be responsible for the soaring rates, and have prompted calls for some contingency measures to be reintroduced.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said this week that cases could hit 100,000 a day, as a new advertising blitz was launched to encourage take-up of booster shots and flu jabs.Concern has been raised about waning immunity levels, given that Britain started its vaccination campaign in December last year, before many other countries.But the government is resisting calls for masks to be worn in crowded indoor spaces again, even as health officials said it could help cut close-contact transmission and ease the burden on hospitals over the coming winter months.Ministers say vaccination rates have helped to cut the link between hospital admissions for more serious cases of Covid and deaths."}

Not only is this an immoral & false narrative, it is dangerous to create these fault-lines & reopen wounds that have taken a generation to heal. We must not put petty political gains above national unity,\" Varun Gandhi tweeted.Varun Gandhi had also shared a video of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence and said, \"The video is crystal clear. Protestors cannot be silenced through murder. There has to be accountability for the innocent blood of farmers that has been spilled and justice must be delivered before a message of arrogance and cruelty enters the minds of every farmer.\"Two days ago, Varun Gandhi shared photos of Terai flood and questioned the meaning of governance if \"every response in individual-led\"."}

The emirates are still rolling out $7 billion for the food corridor that they promised in 2017 with dozens of agro-processing centres and parks being set up across India, expanded port and container investments through joint ventures like Hindustan Infralog, and more. On the supply side are the Narendra Modi government\u2019s farm reforms, designed to move Indian agriculture beyond the unsustainable farming methods of the Green Revolution. The corridor has already survived its first major test \u2014 during the chaos of its Covid waves, India maintained farm supplies to the UAE.\nAll this connectivity infrastructure across the Arabian Sea will also feed into the nearly complete Etihad Rail network.

The party\u2019s Jhuggi Samman Yatra, a 45-day outreach campaign, which started from October 15 and is focused on highlighting the Centre\u2019s \u201cpro-poor schemes\u201d and the Delhi government\u2019s \u201cfailures\u201d, has sparked off a political tussle with AAP and Congress dubbing it an \u201ceyewash\u201d and \u201cfarce\u201d.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said that they have got tremendous response from residents during the yatras. \u201cThe success of our campaign has rattled both AAP and Congress. Both parties, for years, treated slum residents as a vote bank, but did nothing for their welfare,\u201d said Gupta.He said that slum residents are the \u2018Dil (heart) of Delhi\u2019 as they are involved at the grassroots level in running the city, especially during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cBut they were the worst affected during the pandemic, as the state government did nothing for them and stalled the Centre\u2019s pro-poor schemes such as Ayushman Bharat, affordable rental housing scheme, etc. The ration scheme got delayed. The government completely mismanaged the Covid situation. While they paralysed the functioning of civic agencies by stalling funds, the worst part is that the government did nothing to improve the living conditions of people in slum clusters despite having funds,\u201d Gupta said.The BJP, which has covered over 60 slum clusters so far as part of its campaign, plans to start \u2018NaMo jhuggi seva kendras\u2019 in the next few days to help people in availing benefits under various central government schemes.But AAP and Congress leaders say these are nothing but an attempt to cover for its failure in delivering better civic services despite being in power for 15 years.The Congress is planning a \u2018Pol Khol Yatra\u2019 from October 25 to expose BJP and AAP, while the AAP held an outreach programme \u2018Aapka MLA, Aapke Dwar\u2019 in September in which the party claimed to have held 3,000 public meetings to get people\u2019s feedback and discuss the functioning of the municipal corporations.Congress leaders say that both the ruling parties have failed miserably in delivering essential services, especially during the pandemic.\u201cA lot of people lost jobs during the pandemic. In Uttarakhand, (Delhi chief minister) Arvind Kejriwal has promised to pay a monthly stipend of \u20b95,000 to the unemployed youth if AAP is elected. There are 13 lakh people registered with the Delhi government\u2019s job portal. Why doesn\u2019t the government give the same amount to people in Delhi? Similarly, the BJP has completely mismanaged the functioning of municipal corporations, making it difficult for common people to access essential services. We will expose both the parties in our pol khol yatras,\u201d said Delhi Congress chief Chaudhary Anil Kumar.AAP shot back. Senior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak, who oversees municipal affairs in the party, said, \u201cBJP and Congress have governments in various states. I give them an open challenge for a debate on which government did the maximum work during Covid. From providing rations to giving \u20b95,000 compensation to ensure the best treatment to people, no one has done the kind of work the Kejriwal government has done during Covid.\u201dReferring to BJP\u2019s campaign in the slum clusters, Pathak added, \u201cIn the past 15 years, there has been so much corruption in the BJP-led corporations. There is no residential colony left in the city where their councillors have not taken money for allowing construction work. Frankly, the BJP can now only go to slum clusters to get support. But they will not get it as most slums are on DDA land and in the past few years, the land-owning agency has evicted many people. Moreover, they have not done a single thing for the welfare of slum dwellers despite being in power in the corporations for so long.\u201dAbout 1.7 million people live in 675 slums and JJ (jhuggi-jhopri) clusters in Delhi, as per the Delhi Economic Survey-2020-21. While slums are scattered around the city, there are over 33 assembly constituencies and over 100 municipal wards with a high concentration of slums that are a significant vote bank.The BJP has been trying to get the support of the slum dwellers, who once supported Congress and later moved to AAP. Months before the 2017 municipal elections, the then Delhi BJP chief and Northeast Delhi MP, Manoj Tiwari, had started \u2018Ratri Pravas\u2019 (night stay) at slums in a bid to connect the party (which has upper and middle classes as its traditional voters) with the urban poor and migrants. The move had played a crucial role in BJP winning a third term in the civic bodies and improving its previous tally of 138 to 181.But in the 2020 Delhi assembly elections, AAP returned to power with 62 seats, riding high on its focus on education, healthcare and free electricity and water.The Congress hasn\u2019t given up. \u201cWe might have lost the last assembly elections, but we are working hard on the ground. The increase in our vote share during the municipal bypolls earlier this year is an indication that people want Congress back as they acknowledge the work done by us when we were in power,\u201d the Delhi Congress chief said.Political analyst Tanvir Aeijaz, who teaches political science at Ramjas College, said civic elections are fought on local issues that influence the outcome. \u201cWhile all the welfare schemes such as free electricity, water, good education in schools have got the support of the people, it is also the work done by them during the pandemic, such as providing ration, etc, that is likely to help them in municipal elections. BJP, which has 15-years of anti-incumbency, will have to work hard to retain its upper and middle-class vote bank,\u201d Aeijaz said."}
{"text": "The Bombay high court will on Wednesday resume hearing of the bail plea of Aryan Khan in connection with seizure of drugs on a cruise ship. The hearing will resume at 2.30pm today.During the hearing on Khan's bail plea on Tuesday - his third after being arrested on October 3 - the 23-year-old's lawyers told the high court that Aryan should be given bail because no drugs were recovered from him. They also said that WhatsApp conversations used by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) were not related to the cruise where Aryan Khan was arrested from three weeks ago.Former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi was part of the high-powered legal team which sought bail for actor Shah Rukh Khan's son.Aryan Khan is currently lodged in Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail for alleged consumption and conspiracy under the stringent Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.Rohatgi, representing Aryan, argued that his client was invited to the cruise as a special guest and there was no recovery of drugs from him, and no medical examination was conducted to show he consumed drugs. \"No recovery, no consumption, I submit I am wrongly arrested,\" he stressed.Rohatgi also said in his arguments that Aryan Khan was a \"young man\" who should be sent to rehab rather than jail.\"Law provides that for small quantities, the maximum punishment is one year of imprisonment. For consumption, there is rehabilitation as per law,\" Rohatgi argued on behalf of Aryan Khan.He further said that six grams of charas was recovered from accused number 2 (Arbaz Merchant) and Aryan had no relation with him except for arriving with him there.Aryan Khan's bail plea was rejected by the special court on October 20 in the case following which his judicial custody in the case got extended till October 30. Khan approached the Bombay high court for an urgent bail hearing.He was arrested by the NCB on October 3, a day after the agency raided the cruise ship off the coast of Mumbai. A total of 20 people, including two Nigerian nationals, have been arrested so far in the case."}
{"text": "G20 countries, including the USA, European countries and Australia, will bear the extreme impacts of climate change, denting their economies by 2050, a report from the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change (CMCC) said on Wednesday. The report also said that in India, the decline in rice and wheat yields due to climate change could lead to economic losses between 43 and 81 billion EUR (or 1.8-3.4% of GDP) by 2050.The authors of the Atlas refer to three scenarios which are three different development pathways with different levels of greenhouse gas emissions \u2014low, medium, and high. The report comes two days ahead of the G20 summit in Rome on October 30 and 31.Apart from economic losses in India, quality of life and health is likely to be severely impacted, the Atlas has highlighted. Under a low emissions scenario (emissions are substantially lower than in present) projected temperature variations will remain contained under 1.5 degrees C, both by 2050 and 2100. But by 2050, under a high emission scenario, the average temperature could rise to 2 degrees C and over 1.3 degrees C if there is a marginal reduction in emissions or a medium emission pathway. Between 2036 and 2065, the maximum temperature of the warmest month in India could rise by at least 1.2 degrees C in a medium emission pathway and by over 1.7 degrees C in a business-as-usual or high emission scenario.Annual rainfall is likely to record a steep increase by 2050 with an 8% to 19.3% increase in all emission scenarios. India\u2019s marine exclusive economic zone (EEZ) has mostly warm coastal waters with a mosaic of ecosystems such as coral reefs, backwaters, mangroves, and seagrasses meadows, which makes it particularly vulnerable, suggested the Atlas. Sea surface temperatures will increase by over 1.2 to 1.5 degrees C by 2050, while Ph levels, chlorophyll, oxygen levels in marine EEZ will reduce substantially in all emission scenarios. Chlorophyll is an indicator of the biomass available at the base of the marine food web, supporting all ecosystem productivity.Fish catch is also likely to reduce by 8.8% to 17.1% by 2050. Under a medium emissions scenario, the population exposed to the annual coastal flood level is expected to increase from 17 million to 21 million by 2050, the report underlined.Epidemiological risks from dengue and Zika will also increase due to future climate change in India. Under a medium emissions scenario, 98.1% of the population will be at risk of transmission-suitable mean temperatures for dengue by 2050, whereas 97% will be at risk under a high emissions scenario. In the case of Zika, 97.2% of the population will be at risk by 2050 under medium emissions.\u201cAmong the G20, India is lagging in the process of transformation of its energy sector; in particular, the country is at the bottom of the ranking for what regards the \u2018Efficiency\u2019 composite, which takes into account transmission and distribution losses of the electricity grid, the level of energy intensity of the economy and the access to clean cooking services,\u201d the Atlas said.\u201cThis is a very exhaustive report on what would happen with climate change over India. These results are very similar to ministry of earth sciences\u2019 climate change report released last year. But they (CMCC) have gone ahead with impacts analysis. The impacts are very adverse. Even with lower emission scenarios impact could be very severe. All countries should commit to reducing GHG emissions. India\u2019s efforts alone will not help. Probably COP 26 Could be our last chance to save our planet. Hope there will be a consensus by developed countries for reducing fossil fuel emissions. I suggest MOEFCC should take up very detailed impact analysis with IPCC sixth assessment results,\u201d said M Rajeevan, former secretary, ministry of earth sciences responding to the findings.Without any improvement in coastal protection or infrastructure, in a low emission scenario projected asset or infrastructure losses can amount to 121.5 billion EUR by mid-century and by 157.3 billion EUR in a high emission scenario across the globe, the report added.Expected annual damages from riverine flooding by 2050 are estimated to be 376.4 billion EUR under a low emissions scenario and rise to 585.6 billion EUR under a high emissions scenario, the report said.The research shows that rising temperatures and intense heat waves could cause severe droughts and deadly fires. \u201cHeatwaves could last at least ten times longer in all G20 countries, with heatwaves in Argentina, Brazil and Indonesia lasting over 60 times longer by 2050\u2026in Australia, bushfires, coastal floods and hurricanes could raise insurance costs and reduce property values by AUD 611 billion by 2050,\u201d a statement from CMCC said. In Europe, deaths from extreme heat could rise from 2,700 per year to 90,000 each year by 2100 on a high emissions pathway.The report finds that without urgent action to reduce carbon emissions, GDP losses due to climate damage in G20 countries increase each year, rising to at least 4% annually by 2050.CMCC uses an ensemble of Global Circulation Model (GCM) data as those included in the fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project for its projections.Donatella Spano of CMCC, who coordinated the report, said, \u201cFrom droughts, heatwaves and sea-level rise, to dwindling food supplies and threats to tourism \u2013 these findings show how severely climate change will hit the world\u2019s biggest economies unless we act now. As scientists, we know that only rapid action to tackle emissions and adapt to climate change will limit the severe impacts of climate change. At the upcoming summit, we invite G20 governments to listen to the science and put the world on a path to a better, fairer and more stable future.\u201d"}

Sharma has been upset with the party for denying him a ticket, while the party deputed him for electioneering in the Mandi byelections.Maheshwar Singh, a three-time Lok Sabha member scion of the royal family in Kullu, was seeking a ticket from Mandi and is since sulking.Former state BJP president Khimi Ram too is miffed with the party for being ignored. Party affairs in-charge Avinash Rai Khanna had separately met the sulking leaders.Former Rajya Sabha member Kripal Parmar also did not campaign actively in Fatehpur after he was denied the ticket.Six Shimla councillors refused to campaignThe BJP is likely to act against six municipal corporation councillors from Shimla who refused to campaign for the Jubbal-Kotkhai official candidate, Neelam Seraik, in spite of being allocated election duties. \u201cThe party will strongly recommend that the ticket should not be given to councillors who defied its diktat,\u201d said an office-bearer, requesting anonymity.On the other hand, the party will also assess the performance of ministers deputed on poll duties.

{"text": "The global death toll from Covid-19 topped 5 million on Monday, less than two years into a crisis that has not only devastated poor countries but also humbled wealthy ones with first-rate health care systems.Together, the United States, the European Union, Britain and Brazil \u2014 all upper-middle- or high-income countries \u2014 account for one-eighth of the world\u2019s population but nearly half of all reported deaths. The U.S. alone has recorded over 740,000 lives lost, more than any other nation.\u201cThis is a defining moment in our lifetime,\u201d said Dr. Albert Ko, an infectious disease specialist at the Yale School of Public Health. \u201cWhat do we have to do to protect ourselves so we don\u2019t get to another 5 million?\u201dThe death toll, as tallied by Johns Hopkins University, is about equal to the populations of Los Angeles and San Francisco combined. It rivals the number of people killed in battles among nations since 1950, according to estimates from the Peace Research Institute Oslo. Globally, Covid-19 is now the third leading cause of death, after heart disease and stroke.The staggering figure is almost certainly an undercount because of limited testing and people dying at home without medical attention, especially in poor parts of the world, such as India.Hot spots have shifted over the 22 months since the outbreak began, turning different places on the world map red. Now, the virus is pummeling Russia, Ukraine and other parts of Eastern Europe, especially where rumors, misinformation and distrust in government have hobbled vaccination efforts. In Ukraine, only 17% of the adult population is fully vaccinated; in Armenia, only 7%.\u201cWhat\u2019s uniquely different about this pandemic is it hit hardest the high-resource countries,\u201d said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, director of ICAP, a global health center at Columbia University. \u201cThat\u2019s the irony of Covid-19.\u201dWealthier nations with longer life expectancies have larger proportions of older people, cancer survivors and nursing home residents, all of whom are especially vulnerable to Covid-19, El-Sadr noted. Poorer countries tend to have larger shares of children, teens and young adults, who are less likely to fall seriously ill from the coronavirus.India, despite its terrifying delta surge that peaked in early May, now has a much lower reported daily death rate than wealthier Russia, the US or Britain, though there is uncertainty around its figures.The seeming disconnect between wealth and health is a paradox that disease experts will be pondering for years. But the pattern that is seen on the grand scale, when nations are compared, is different when examined at closer range. Within each wealthy country, when deaths and infections are mapped, poorer neighborhoods are hit hardest.In the US, for example, Covid-19 has taken an outsize toll on Black and Hispanic people, who are more likely than white people to live in poverty and have less access to health care.\u201cWhen we get out our microscopes, we see that within countries, the most vulnerable have suffered most,\" Ko said.Wealth has also played a role in the global vaccination drive, with rich countries accused of locking up supplies. The U.S. and others are already dispensing booster shots at a time when millions across Africa haven\u2019t received a single dose, though the rich countries are also shipping hundreds of millions of shots to the rest of the world.Africa remains the world\u2019s least vaccinated region, with just 5% of the population of 1.3 billion people fully covered.In Kampala, Uganda, Cissy Kagaba lost her 62-year-old mother on Christmas Day and her 76-year-old father days later.\u201cChristmas will never be the same for me,\u201d said Kagaba, an anti-corruption activist in the East African country that has been through multiple lockdowns against the virus and where a curfew remains in place.The pandemic has united the globe in grief and pushed survivors to the breaking point.\u201cWho else is there now? The responsibility is on me. Covid has changed my life,\" said 32-year-old Reena Kesarwani, a mother of two boys, who was left to manage her late husband\u2019s modest hardware store in a village in India.Her husband, Anand Babu Kesarwani, died at 38 during India's crushing coronavirus surge earlier this year. It overwhelmed one of the most chronically underfunded public health systems in the world and killed tens of thousands as hospitals ran out of oxygen and medicine.In Bergamo, Italy, once the site of the West\u2019s first deadly wave, 51-year-old Fabrizio Fidanza was deprived of a final farewell as his 86-year-old father lay dying in the hospital. He is still trying to come to terms with the loss more than a year later.\u201cFor the last month, I never saw him,\u2019\u2019 Fidanza said during a visit to his father's grave. \u201cIt was the worst moment. But coming here every week, helps me.\u201dToday, 92% of Bergamo\u2019s eligible population have had at least one shot, the highest vaccination rate in Italy. The chief of medicine at Pope John XXIII Hospital, Dr. Stefano Fagiuoli, said he believes that\u2019s a clear result of the city\u2019s collective trauma, when the wail of ambulances was constant.In Lake City, Florida, LaTasha Graham, 38, still gets mail almost daily for her 17-year-old daughter, Jo\u2019Keria, who died of COVID-19 in August, days before starting her senior year of high school. The teen, who was buried in her cap and gown, wanted to be a trauma surgeon.\u201cI know that she would have made it.

However, an officer in the CMO confirmed that resignation has been accepted and further course of action will be announced shortly.Regarding the latest rate cut in power tariff that was effective from Monday, Channi said electricity was now the cheapest in Punjab, while adding that this would bring in an additional burden of Rs. 3,316 crore on the state exchequer and add up to \u20b914,000 crore when the total annual power subsidy bill is calculated which included subsidies on agri pumpsets. \u201c \u20b91.19 will be the new rate for small consumers,\u201d he said.\u201cWith today\u2019s announcement, 95 per cent consumers have been covered touching 69 lakh consumers out of a total 72 lakh consumers with the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited,\u201d Channi said at a press conference in Chandigarh.He further said the government had decided to terminate its agreements with the GVK-owned power plant in Goindwal Sahib \u00a0that was providing electricity at \u20b96-7 per unit. \u201cWe will also rework power purchase agreements with two other privately owned thermal plants in Punjab by bringing in legislation in the upcoming session of the Assembly on Nov 8,\u201d he said.Speaking about the DA hike of government employees, Channi said, \u201cOn the occasion of Diwali, I wanted to give them a gift, one that they never had before.

{"text": "Indian weapons company SSS Defence will begin manufacturing and testing small arms at its new facility that will be operational in Bengaluru in January 2022, with the complex also housing a first-of-its kind underground weapons testing tunnel to determine their effectiveness, the firm\u2019s CEO Vivek Krishnan said on Monday.\u201cThis will be our first full-fledged facility where we will carry out integrated research and development, manufacturing and testing of weapons,\u201d he said. Security audits by the ministry of home affairs are currently on at the manufacturing unit.In a needed boost to the government\u2019s Make in India campaign, the weapons factory will make SSS Defence the second private sector company in India to manufacture small arms for the local and export markets after PLR Systems Ltd (PLR), a joint venture between Adani Group and Israel Weapon Industries (IWI).The 150-metre-long tunnel will be the first underground facility to be set up by a private sector company in the country for testing and evaluation of weapons ranging from pistols and assault rifles to carbines and sniper rifles, people familiar with the matter said. The testing process allows manufacturers to gather crucial tactical weapon data including muzzle velocity, action time and consistency.Experts said the development was an indicator of the small arms manufacturing business coming of age in the private sector and the Indian military and paramilitary would have cheaper indigenous options to choose from.The four-year-old firm SSS Defence emerged as the lowest bidder for a contract to upgrade a small number of Indian Army\u2019s AK-47 assault rifles, beating off competition from established Israeli rival Fab Defense, as reported by Hindustan Times on Sunday.Thus far it has built prototype weapons such as assault rifles and sniper rifles at a \u2018bridge\u2019 or make-shift facility in Bengaluru, and the new facility will allow the Bengaluru-based firm to ramp up annual production to 20,000 assault rifles and 3,000 sniper rifles depending on orders, Krishnan said.PLR is working on its first order to supply Masada 9mm pistols to the Indian Navy\u2019s elite marine commandos, said one of persons cited above. The JV is manufacturing at its Gwalior facility the complete range of IWI weapons such as Tavor assault rifles, X95 assault rifles, Galil sniper rifles, Negev light machine guns and Uzi submachine guns.The weapons to be manufactured at SSS Defence\u2019s eight-acre unit at Jigani near Bengaluru\u2019s well-known technology hub, Electronic City, include the Viper and Saber sniper rifles, P-72 assault rifles and the P-72 carbines, Krishnan said. The weapons facility represents an investment of around \u20b9200 crore.The company is also setting up an ammunition manufacturing plant at Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh that is expected to be operational next year.Achieving self-reliance in the small arms sector is critical, said military affairs expert Lieutenant General DB Shekatkar (retd).\u201cApart from the military, paramilitary organisations and state police forces need to be equipped with quality small arms for better response,\u201d said Shekatkar.Rahul Singh covers military affairs.

HT called up on the numbers available on the company\u2019s website, but couldn\u2019t contact company officials.CPWD, which is the nodal agency for the execution of the Central Vista Project, received six financial bids for the project -- of which five were higher than the department\u2019s estimated cost. The second lowest bid received was of \u20b9220.02 crore from SAM India Builtwell Pvt Ltd.The other four companies which submitted the financial bids are: Ahluwalia contracts (India) limited ( \u20b9268.76 crore), DEE VEE Projects limited ( \u20b9238.86 crore), PSP projects Ltd (252.56 crore) and Swadeshi Civil Infrastructure Pvt Ltd ( \u20b9229.33 crore), according to CPWD officials.In August, 12 construction firms participated in the pre-qualification bids for the project of which only nine firms qualified to apply for financial bids.The enclave is the fourth main component of the \u20b913,500 crore Central Vista redevelopment project. As per the proposed plan, the enclave will have the Vice President\u2019s residence, secretariat, sports facility, guest house, and housing facility for security services and staff. Most of the buildings will be double storeyed (ground plus one) and the total built-up area will be around 20,000 sq m, as per the tender document.The initial project cost was \u20b9192 crore, as per the pre-qualification bid document.\u201cThe construction work is likely to start by December this year,\u201d the CPWD official quoted above said.In October 2020, the Centre changed the land-use of the plot in the Master Plan of Delhi-2021 from transportation (bus terminal/parking) and recreational to residential for the redevelopment project. This change in land use has been challenged in the Supreme Court, and the apex court recently sought the Centre\u2019s reply on the petition.In response to the petition, the Centre told the apex court last week that the Central Vista plots sought to be made the new residences of the Prime Minister and Vice President have never been open for any public recreational purpose. Explaining why the Vice President\u2019s residence was proposed for construction on Plot No. 1, the Centre said, \u201cThis will in turn help in easing the traffic situation in Central Vista as the movement of Vice President will be mainly to the Parliament when in session. This will be well facilitated by the proposed Vice President Residence being in close proximity to the Parliament.\u201d The matter will come up for hearing on November 16.Meanwhile, the construction work of the new Parliament building and Central Vista Avenue are in full swing. The new Parliament building is expected to be ready by October-November next year, while the revamped Central Vista Avenue will be ready by December.CPWD is in the process of awarding the work for the construction of first three buildings of the proposed Common Central Secretariat (a set of 10 buildings that will house all the 51 central ministries) to Larsen and Toubro Ltd. The construction and infrastructure major was the lowest bidder for the \u20b93,254-crore project. L&T\u2019s bid ( \u20b93,141.99) was 3.47% less than the government\u2019s estimated cost.The three buildings of the common secretariat will come up where Indira Gandhi Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) was earlier located. IGNCA has been temporarily relocated to the renovated Janpath hotel, and a new IGNCA complex will be constructed at Jamnagar House."}

They are distraught over the lack of a law on \u201ckirpan\u201d as it is curtailed due to security concerns, while Pakistan\u2019s constitution guarantees freedom of religion, reported The Express Tribune.Adult Sikhs usually carry a 4 to 5-inch kirpan, kept in a sheath, which can be worn under or over the clothing. The \u201ckirpan\u201d amongst other things symbolises the struggle against injustice and is an integral part of the religion.The Sikh community of the province has been pushing for legislation to be allowed permission to carry the kirpan when they visit government offices, enter the court or police station, and during air travel, reported The Express Tribune.Ranjeett Singh, a minority member of the provincial assembly, has been the most vocal about such legislation ever since he was not allowed to carry the steel sword in the provincial assembly.Ranjeett, while talking to The Express Tribune, said: \u201cWhen I enter the assembly, I am often asked to leave my sword outside due to which it has to be kept in my car or briefcase.\u201d He said that being told to not carry the sword was hurtful to his religious sentiments.The provincial lawmaker is not alone.

{"text": "Virat Kohli may not have scored a century in two years but the India captain still continues to be one of the best batters in world cricket not only among current cricketers but also across era. Kohli's rise to greatness has been at such a pace that despite not being at his best in the last couple of years, he is still miles ahead in terms of runs and centuries among modern-day cricketers. With 70 international centuries, Kohli is third on the list only behind Sachin Tendulkar (100) and Ricky Ponting (71). The Indian captain has 23159, which is the seventh most in the list of all-time highest run-scorers in international cricket and is also the only one averaging over 50 across formats among 11 great cricketers who have managed to notch up more than 20000 international runs. As Kohli turns 33 on Friday, here is a look at five knocks that prove he is one of the greatest batters ever.1. Hurricane in Hobart (133* vs Sri Lanka, 2012)Despite having scored eight centuries leading up to this contest against Sri Lanka, it was in Hobart during the 2012 CB series that Kohli really came of age. With India in the middle of a sloppy campaign having being blanked in the Test series 0-4 and enduring not the greatest of tri-series, Kohli played the innings of a lifetime. Kohli dished out a memorable assault en route to scoring an unbeaten 133 off just 86 balls to help India gun down 321 runs in less than 37 overs. His treatment of Lasith Malinga was the stuff of legends. He took the yorker specialist for 24 runs in an over in perhaps the most dominating batting performance seen against him.Also Read | \u2018Don\u2019t tell Dravid how to run the team': Jadeja's request to BCCI2. Asia Cup classic (183 vs Pakistan, 2012, Dhaka)Rarely do things get bigger than an India-Pakistan match. Just months after Kohli had ripped the skin off Sri Lanka, the batsman, playing his second Asia Cup tournament, rose to the big occasion and peeled off a match-winning century. With Pakistan posting 329/6 and India losing opening batsman Gautam Gambhir without a run on board, in walked Kohli and took some time before he punished a rather decent Pakistan bowling attack. Kohli hit 22 fours and a six to score a career-best 183, grabbing the bowlers by the scruff of their neck and seeing India through inside 48 overs. He was ably supported by half-centuries from Tendulkar and Rohit Sharma.3. Mohali epic (82* vs Australia, 2016 World T20)2016 was one of Kohli\u2019s best years in international cricket, and with the World T20 World Cup being played in India, the batsman\u2019s eyes lit up. He emerged as the Man of the Series in the tournament but his innings against Australia during a Super 10 match stood out.Kohli had already taken India to a win against Pakistan with a testing half-century but it was his knock in Mohali that catapulted him as a T20 great. Chasing 161 to win and with India in a bit of a spot at 49/3, Kohli and Yuvraj Singh started rebuilding the innings. Once Yuvraj was out with India on 94/4, Kohli channelled his inner beast to stage a beautiful partnership with MS Dhoni. Kohli reached his fifty but it wasn\u2019t the biggest highlight of the match. Already labelled as India\u2019s \u2018Master of the Chase,\u2019 he ran between the wickets like a maniac and with 39 to get off three, launched James Faulkner for 14 off the first three. Next over, Kohli clattered Nathan Coulter-Night for three fours in the over to bring the equation down to four needed off the final over. Dhoni hit the winning runs but the sight of Kohli falling on the ground and soaking the moment showed how much it meant to him.Also Read | \u2018There are many candidates but he\u2019s the best': Sehwag picks next India captain4. Burying the ghosts of England (149 vs England, Birmingham, 2018)After the nightmarish tour of England in 2014, where he averaged a poor 13.50, Kohli redeemed himself when he led India to the country four years later. But this time around, Kohli led from the front and ended the five-Test series with an average of 59.30, scoring 593 runs. In the first Test of the series, Kohli batted with great grit and determination to score 149 \u2013 while not other Indian batsman could go past 26. It was an inning where he was engaged in an attritional battle with James Anderson, his nemesis from the previous tour. In the third Test, Kohli peeled off scores of 97 and 103, and even though India lost the series 1-4, Kohli was able to bury the ghosts of his traumatic past.5. Achieving batting nirvana in Adelaide (115 and 141 vs Australia, 2014)Kohli, in his first Test as captain, nearly saw India home had it not been for one of India\u2019s famous collapses. In the absence of Dhoni, who was nursing a finger injury, Kohli scored twin centuries in Adelaide, his knock of 115 in the first innings leading India\u2019s strong reply of 444 to Australia\u2019s 517/7 declared. In the second innings, Australia declared on 290/5, setting India 362 runs to get. Kohli anchored another fighting knock of 141, and along with Murali Vijay, took India to 242/2, a stage where they looked likely to grab an early 1-0 lead. But off-spinner Nathan Lyon claimed 7/152 and in the process, triggered one of India\u2019s worst batting collapses, which saw them lose eight wickets for 73 runs to be bowled out for 315."}

If we could speak fluently at two, the conversations would likely be peppered with expletives (well, almost).\n\nThe next time the individual feels quite that unsettled is, typically, in adolescence. Both the terrible twos and the teen years are periods of discovery and the testing of boundaries, of rapid physical and emotional development, and monumental phases of learning. \nThis turbulence at adolescence was broadly described as teen angst, stereotypically characterised by the slamming of doors, monosyllabic responses, sullen faces, new dietary preferences, sartorial surprises, defiant choices in music, and an overarching sense of stress and insecurity. \u201cThere\u2019s also a forming of new groups and a greater degree of affiliation with that group. Choices, likes and dislikes are often shared. Approaches to privacy and decision-making change, all as part of a natural push for autonomy,\u201d says K John Vijay Sagar, professor and head of child and adolescent psychiatry at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in Bengaluru. \nBut that was then. \nAngst is turning, increasingly, to anxiety as the stresses of adolescence meet the stresses of life in the 21st century. Teens around the world are growing up in environments of greater volatility, from heightened academic competition to rapid rates of change, a future of uncertain employment opportunities, the daily strain of social media and, increasingly, the climate crisis. \nIndia has the largest adolescent population of any country in the world (253 million people aged 10 to 19). About 1 in 5 school-going adolescents lives with anxiety, stress and / or depression, according to a 2019 report by NIMHANS. A 2021 UNICEF study turned up a similar number: one in seven Indians aged 15 to 24 reported feeling depressed or had little interest in engaging in activities, it found.\nWHY\n\u201cToday adolescents may not have the coping skills necessary to deal with the issues they face, which are greater than those faced by generations before them. Without healthy coping skills that stress can turn into something more serious,\u201d says N Janardhana of Project SAMA, a research project focused on creating networks of support for adolescents in India, led jointly by the UK\u2019s University of Leeds and NIMHANS. \nA 2017 book by Jean Twenge, psychologist and professor at San Diego State University, points out that rates of reported anxiety and despair in high school students in America have been on the rise since 2012. \nThe book (titled iGen: Why Today\u2019s Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy\u2014and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood\u2014and What That Means for the Rest of Us) refers to those born between 1995 and 2012 as iGen, the first generation that grew up in a world of smartphones and social media and does not remember a time before the internet. \n\u201cThere was one societal shift over the past decade that influenced the lives of today\u2019s teens and young adults more than any other generation: the spread of smartphones and digital media like social media, texting and gaming,\u201d Twenge told Wknd. \u201cCompared with their predecessors, teens today spend less time with their friends in person and more time communicating electronically, which study after study has found is associated with mental health issues.\u201d\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\nOne way to slow the onslaught from devices and social media is to create internet-free zones in the home. Whether you are an adolescent or are raising one, let it be known that there are hours in the day or spaces in the home where a call or text will work best, says Dr Samir Dalwai, a developmental paediatrician and founder of the New Horizons Health and Research Foundation.\nTie this in with a healthy schedule that aims to balance sleep, recreation, physical activity and device-free periods such as mealtimes. Ideally, limit social media to a certain number of hours a day. \nPrioritise kindness, Dalwai adds. Social media is tailormade for snap judgements, of oneself and others. \u201cIt\u2019s important for adolescents to learn self-compassion and compassion for others as an alternative to the vanity, judgement and overall performative nature of growing up on social media,\u201d Dalwai says. \nAnd let that be the start. Here\u2019s what else you can do to help the adolescents in your life. \nMake the time: Find things to do together. Try to take a real interest in what they enjoy. Whether it\u2019s Fortnite or Instagram Reels, it\u2019s over the things that interest them that you are most likely to have a real conversation. \nAvoid negative validation: Refrain from telling a child to do better. Instead, use words of encouragement to indicate to an adolescent what you appreciate about them in a given context. So, \u201cIt made me happy to see you talking to the new neighbour\u201d not \u201cYou should be more confident and speak up more\u201d. Also, focus on telling the child what their options are in a given scenario, rather than the things they can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t do. As they figure out who they are, there are bound to be inconsistencies. Preconceived notions of exactly who they should be can feel like added pressure. \nListen: Of course you want to rush in and fix things. This is your kid, and you remember being this kid too. But it will help your relationship with your adolescent if you learn to listen, with an open mind, without interrupting. Knowing there is someone to talk to, in safety and without judgement, is essential for anyone living with stress or anxiety.

Both the terrible twos and the teen years are periods of discovery and the testing of boundaries, of rapid physical and emotional development, and monumental phases of learning.This turbulence at adolescence was broadly described as teen angst, stereotypically characterised by the slamming of doors, monosyllabic responses, sullen faces, new dietary preferences, sartorial surprises, defiant choices in music, and an overarching sense of stress and insecurity. \u201cThere\u2019s also a forming of new groups and a greater degree of affiliation with that group. Choices, likes and dislikes are often shared. Approaches to privacy and decision-making change, all as part of a natural push for autonomy,\u201d says K John Vijay Sagar, professor and head of child and adolescent psychiatry at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in Bengaluru.But that was then.Angst is turning, increasingly, to anxiety as the stresses of adolescence meet the stresses of life in the 21st century. Teens around the world are growing up in environments of greater volatility, from heightened academic competition to rapid rates of change, a future of uncertain employment opportunities, the daily strain of social media and, increasingly, the climate crisis.India has the largest adolescent population of any country in the world (253 million people aged 10 to 19). About 1 in 5 school-going adolescents lives with anxiety, stress and / or depression, according to a 2019 report by NIMHANS. A 2021 UNICEF study turned up a similar number: one in seven Indians aged 15 to 24 reported feeling depressed or had little interest in engaging in activities, it found.WHY\u201cToday adolescents may not have the coping skills necessary to deal with the issues they face, which are greater than those faced by generations before them. Without healthy coping skills that stress can turn into something more serious,\u201d says N Janardhana of Project SAMA, a research project focused on creating networks of support for adolescents in India, led jointly by the UK\u2019s University of Leeds and NIMHANS.A 2017 book by Jean Twenge, psychologist and professor at San Diego State University, points out that rates of reported anxiety and despair in high school students in America have been on the rise since 2012.The book (titled iGen: Why Today\u2019s Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy\u2014and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood\u2014and What That Means for the Rest of Us) refers to those born between 1995 and 2012 as iGen, the first generation that grew up in a world of smartphones and social media and does not remember a time before the internet.\u201cThere was one societal shift over the past decade that influenced the lives of today\u2019s teens and young adults more than any other generation: the spread of smartphones and digital media like social media, texting and gaming,\u201d Twenge told Wknd. \u201cCompared with their predecessors, teens today spend less time with their friends in person and more time communicating electronically, which study after study has found is associated with mental health issues.\u201dWHAT YOU CAN DOOne way to slow the onslaught from devices and social media is to create internet-free zones in the home. Whether you are an adolescent or are raising one, let it be known that there are hours in the day or spaces in the home where a call or text will work best, says Dr Samir Dalwai, a developmental paediatrician and founder of the New Horizons Health and Research Foundation.Tie this in with a healthy schedule that aims to balance sleep, recreation, physical activity and device-free periods such as mealtimes. Ideally, limit social media to a certain number of hours a day.Prioritise kindness, Dalwai adds. Social media is tailormade for snap judgements, of oneself and others. \u201cIt\u2019s important for adolescents to learn self-compassion and compassion for others as an alternative to the vanity, judgement and overall performative nature of growing up on social media,\u201d Dalwai says.And let that be the start. Here\u2019s what else you can do to help the adolescents in your life.Make the time: Find things to do together. Try to take a real interest in what they enjoy. Whether it\u2019s Fortnite or Instagram Reels, it\u2019s over the things that interest them that you are most likely to have a real conversation.Avoid negative validation: Refrain from telling a child to do better. Instead, use words of encouragement to indicate to an adolescent what you appreciate about them in a given context. So, \u201cIt made me happy to see you talking to the new neighbour\u201d not \u201cYou should be more confident and speak up more\u201d. Also, focus on telling the child what their options are in a given scenario, rather than the things they can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t do. As they figure out who they are, there are bound to be inconsistencies. Preconceived notions of exactly who they should be can feel like added pressure.Listen: Of course you want to rush in and fix things. This is your kid, and you remember being this kid too. But it will help your relationship with your adolescent if you learn to listen, with an open mind, without interrupting. Knowing there is someone to talk to, in safety and without judgement, is essential for anyone living with stress or anxiety. Create a safe space where your child can feel seen and heard.Acknowledge the fears, however irrational they may seem: It\u2019s essential that an adolescent (and in fact any child) learn that their thoughts and opinions are of value. If you want to help conquer an anxiety, it helps to be positive but realistic. Is weight becoming a worry to your your teen? Focus on health and how they feel, empathise with the struggle, avoid all labels and show pride in your child\u2019s efforts to improve.Remember the goal: The goal is never to eliminate anxiety, but to help your child to learn to manage it. Ask questions, offer suggestions. But let them lead. This is when they will learn to confront adult issues and arrive at possible ways forward themselves.Ask for their opinion: In a world that is constantly telling them what to think, encourage your adolescent to think for themselves."}

Safar had earlier forecast that during Diwali, the AQI for Pune city was deteriorate to a very poor level. The weather department has also forecast that the city will not witness any rainfall in the coming few days.Speaking about the air quality, BS Murthy, director, Safar and scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), said that due to heavy rainfall at some places in the city, the air quality was better than forecasted.\u201cWe had forecasted poor to very poor air quality in parts of the city. However, on November 4 evening, many places in the city experienced rainfall which was intense. Due to this, the air quality was better than forecasted,\u201d Murthy said.As per Safar, the air quality on Sunday was good at Pashan, Katraj, Hadapsar, Lohegaon, Alandi, Bhosari, Nigdi, Alandi and Bhumkar chowk. At Shivajinagar and Kothrud, the air quality was moderate on Sunday.As per Safar, PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels were 32 \u03bcg/m3 (concentration of air pollutants in micrograms per cubic metre of air).Whereas on Sunday, the PM10 (atmospheric particulate matter that has a diameter of less than 10 micrometres) was 60 \u03bcg/m3.Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting department of IMD Pune said that there is a depression forming in Arabian Sea.\u201cThis depression is likely to intensify and move away from the Indian coast. So rainfall chances in southern and central parts of Maharashtra are likely to reduce. In Pune district as well, the chances of rainfall are likely to reduce drastically in the next few days,\u201d said Kashyapi.However, in November alone, Pune district has reported 430 per cent excess rainfall. Maharashtra, as well, has reported 47 per cent excess rainfall in November, as per IMD."}
{"text": "As more schools in Delhi reopen for in-person classes after the Diwali break, they will have to contend with hazardous pollution levels in the city, a concern schools said took a backseat as Covid-mitigation measures became their primary focus.Most heads of school said they will limit outdoor physical activity till the air quality improves.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, which reopens for in-person classes on Thursday, said, \u201cAs pollution peaks, especially after Diwali, we abort outdoor physical activity and will continue to do the same once we reopen. We have already outlined in our operating guidelines that there will be limitations on some sports and outdoor activities due to prevailing concerns around Covid-19 and pollution levels.\u201dSo far, around 70% of the students\u2019 parents in the school have consented to let their children attend physical classes, authorities of the institution said. Most students, however, have declined to opt for the school\u2019s transport services, likely due to the fear of Covid-19 spreading.\u201cWe are still in the process of obtaining parents\u2019 consent. Some parents are still weighing the options, due to which responses are arriving slowly. It is possible that the pollution levels may be one of the factors due to which parents are taking their time to consent to physical classes,\u201d said Arora.For the first few days after reopening, the school will focus on interactive sessions with students on a range of topics, including the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change.\u201cTeachers will have detailed discussions with children on mental and physical health, climate change, and other concerns so that there is meaningful dialogue,\u201d said Arora.Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said that the institution will limit outdoor activity and hold shorter classes.\u201cWe will have classes for between three and three-and-a-half hours, so pollution shouldn\u2019t play a major role right now. Parents are already a little apprehensive due to Covid-19, so I\u2019d say that pollution is among the factors [we are considering]. Due to the pandemic, pollution has taken a backseat in comparison to pre-Covid times,\u201d said Joshi.Government schools also said they will keep physical activities to a minimum.AK Jha, principal of the Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Rohini, said that while pollution was prevalent, it may not majorly impact attendance this year.\u201cI think children will continue to visit school, especially at a time when classes have resumed after a long gap,\u201d said Jha.He said that students had been directed to wear full-sleeved shirts and consume \u2018amla\u2019 every day. \u201cEvery year, I advise children to consume amla, so that they can stay healthy as pollution levels peak,\u201d said Jha.M Shariq, principal of the School of Specialized Excellence in Kalkaji, said a large number of students may join classes once the Chhath festivities end on November 10.

{"text": "In Mahim Koliwada, a fishing colony metres from the city\u2019s coastline, the day starts at 3 am for 47-year-old Bhushan Nijai. It started just as early for his father Yeshwant (72), and deceased grandfather Pandav, who have been fishing in the sane waters for the past 90 years. Nijai\u2019s children \u2014 three girls aged 6 to 22 years \u2014 however, don\u2019t wake up at the crack of dawn like their father. Unlike Nijai, who joined his family\u2019s occupation as a fisher immediately after completing his Class 12, they don\u2019t have anything to do with the trade.The Nijais aren\u2019t the only family in the hamlet whose youngest generation has veered away from the century-old work. Their neighbour, Nitin Vaidya, has two young children, a girl aged 10 years and a boy aged six, neither of whom will be taking up the trade.Most of the fishers \u2014 all men \u2014 from the 5,000-resident strong Mahim village who take their boats out each morning are above 35. For them, catching, selling and eating fishing is their \u201castitva\u201d (identity), they say.Nijhai\u2019s oldest, Raksha, who is a commerce graduate, aspires for an office job. \u201cI have seen my parents work very hard. My mother (Smita) also wakes up around 3am and goes to buy fish at Sassoon Docks, which she sells at a fish market in Dadar. They work long hours but our family\u2019s debts have only increased. I know how to clean and buy fish, but if our situation has to improve I can\u2019t continue in this line,\u201d she said.Smita Nijai does not sell the fish that her husband catches; her business \u2014 and earnings \u2014 are separate. Depending on the day\u2019s catch, Nijai sells the fish to wholesalers or small hotels.Fishing communities that have, by most historical accounts, lived along the Mumbai coastline since the 15th century, are increasingly finding their occupation unviable.More than a tradeIn 2003, Maharashtra\u2019s department of fisheries estimated that 37,695 people in Greater Mumbai are completely reliant on small-scale fishing activities [or as it is called, artisan fishing, marked by small capital, short fishing trips closer to shore, use of small fishing vessels and local consumption].In 2010, state-run Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute estimated that there were 40,953 small-scale fishers across the Greater Mumbai region, residing in 30 fishing villages. With an average family size of 4.4, that\u2019s about 9,307 families \u2014 in a city of over 20 million \u2014 who are dependent on fishing and allied activities that includes everything from cold storage to boat repairs, net making and mending to selling fish.\u201cThe number of people, at least within Greater Mumbai, who are opting to fish full time, is only a small portion of our larger community,\u201d said Devendra Tandel (40), who heads the state\u2019s largest fisherfolk society, Akhil Maharashtra Machimaar Kruti Samiti. Tandel now has a full time job in a private bank.\u201cCommercial trawling, overfishing, the cost of fuel and other operating capital is increasing, and there is an influx of migrant workers who now dominate the sale and distribution of fish,\u201d Tandel said listing the issues that the fisherfolk community contends are problems that threaten them.\u201cI have friends from the community who are doing jobs in IT and software and finance. Fishing can always be a backup for us, but it is not first choice.\u201d\u201cI am the last generation of my household that will stick to this occupation. In our line of work, we struggle to make ends meet and I don\u2019t want the same fate for them,\u201d Nijai said.Development storyBut the community is currently dealing with another, more pressing concern. The city\u2019s landscape is undergoing changes and the kolis are on the edge.In 2011, a Joint Technical Committee of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) proposed a radical alteration to the city\u2019s coastline that would connect the city\u2019s southernmost tip to the suburbs of Vasai-Virar 70km away. In its current format, the Mumbai Coastal Road project includes a network of under-sea tunnels, elevated roads and several interchanges, most of which will be created over the sea and partly over reclaimed land.There is also the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link, off the eastern seafront, which promises to be the longest sea-bridge in the country. Add to this a range of beautification projects involving the reclamation of near-shore areas (comprising mangroves and sandy beaches) in Cuffe Parade and Versova.In 2018, the Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) was appointed the special planning authority (SPA) for beautifying 966.30 hectares along the city\u2019s 28-km eastern seafront. The plan also proposes public parks, plazas, promenades, walking trails and marinas apart from restaurants and caf\u00e9s.The Union ministry for environment and climate change recently gave its nod to the Coastal Zone Management Plans (CZMPs) for Mumbai city and suburban districts, thus allowing construction up to 50m from the city\u2019s high-tide line. This follows a 2019 amendment to the Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ) rules which, up until then, had prevented development up to 500m from the city\u2019s high-tide line.With the easing of this norm, existing coastal properties would be allowed to develop at least two and a half times their existing floor space. Liases Foras, a real estate research firm, estimates that around 10,000 old buildings in Mumbai will benefit from this.And now, the effectWork on the first phase of the Coastal Road project began in 2018 and since then, fishing communities have attempted to direct the attention of the city municipality and the state government to the impact of this project on fishing commons \u2014the shore and intertidal areas that are collectively used by the community without title.At Cleveland Bunder, a fishing port in Worli koliwada (fishing village), two connecting bridges will come up between the coastal road at Worli and the Bandra Worli Sea Link (BWSL) to allow seamless flow of traffic. Fisherfolk said this interchange will severely constrict the only navigational route available to their boats venturing out to the open sea.Since October 30, residents of the village have been staging a protest at sea at the site of this upcoming interchange: fishers in 100 boats have dropped anchors near a construction site in Worli, where an interchange is slated to come up and, which the fisherfolk say, will prevent safe passage to fishing commons. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal has agreed to an independent review of their demands for a re-design of the interchange.Other fishers along the South Mumbai coast from Priyadarshini Park to Worli too, have begun to report declining fish stocks \u2014 in this particular stretch, land has been reclaimed and a connecting bridge is coming up at Haji Ali \u2014 as space for small-scale fishers on non-motorised boats and fisherwomen to pick oysters and shellfish has reduced.This comes at a time when the state\u2019s fish stocks are showing a drastic decline. In 2019-20, fish landings reported their lowest harvest in 45 years, while reports show a decreasing, year-on-year trend since 2017.Fisher communities who stay on the eastern coastline in places like Sewri, Mazagaon, and Wadala fear that beautification projects like the one being planned by MbPT, would recast indigenous land use to a public space for larger citizenry that would eventually nudge them out.Fisherfolk are also caught in the net of other development projects.For instance, in Bandra\u2019s Chimbai village, the fisheries department is building a jetty and construction material now occupies the grounds used by fisherfolk to sort and dry fish. Although the land is owned by the BMC, its own Development Plan 2034 for Mumbai has classified this area as \u201ca fish and net drying yard.\u201d (The civic body can affect a change in the land use, but there is a process for it to do so.)In September, in response to a petition by the Mariyayi Macchimar Sahakari Sanstha Maryadit, a society of fishers in and around Thane creek, the Bombay high court instituted a committee to create a fisherfolk rehabilitation policy for the state that would devise a standard operating procedure to gauge the impact of development projects undertaken by the government that affect fisher communities.Saving a way of lifeOne of the things that fisherfolk are demanding is freehold possession of their commons (land on which they park their boats, or dry fish, for example) because there is no public document available that delineates what land belongs to them, and what can be rightfully used by the state.\u201cAll the koliwadas in Mumbai are supposed to be mapped and demarcated in the coastal zone management plan (CZMP). This is a provision of the CRZ 2019 as well. In Mumbai, the koliwadas have been mapped, but the plans have not been released for public scrutiny, revised and accordingly incorporated in the CZMP. It leaves us completely in the dark about which lands around our villages are going to be opened up for development,\u201d Tandel said.The community has tried to adapt, of course, with some assistance from the fisheries department that has provided critical infrastructure like fish landing centres in Mumbai\u2019s koliwadas and diesel subsidies. Others have tried supplementing their traditional livelihoods with more aspirational jobs.Nijhai estimates that in his own lifetime, the income from fishing has shrunk by three quarters. The pandemic only sped up the process. \u201cIt is really the poorest of the poor who are left to fend for themselves on fishing. Our practice won\u2019t die out, but the struggle will get harder,\u201d he said.Sanjay Wategaonkar, Assistant commissioner of fisheries department, Mumbai districtWe are committed to helping small scale fishers... We are pushing for starting a credit scheme similar to the Central government\u2019s Kisan Credit Card. As for impact of infra projects, we provide NOCs only if the project proponent commits to not disrupting fisherfolk livelihoodsBhushan Nijai, Fisher, Mahim Koliwada\u201cI am the last generation of my household that will stick to this occupation. In our line of work, we struggle to make ends meet and I don\u2019t want the same fate for them."}

Lately, the number of people using mobile payments has increased significantly.Mobile payment allows you to pay for goods and services without carrying physical cash in your bag or wallet. It is indeed good, but despite its positivity, every technological innovation has its fair share of negativity. But it appears that firms like ipaytotal are working hard to remove most cons linked to mobile payments. Let's take a look!Pros of mobile paymentWhen mobile payment functions the way it is designed, it is comfortable and reliable. Now, let's see other benefits of Mobile payment.SecuredThe mobile payment app does not send nor store your card information when you fill in your card details. The app verifies the information you provided with your financial institution.A token is used to represent your information. Every transaction is made using that token, which makes it difficult for hackers to get your card information from mobile apps.In addition, if your phone is missing or stolen by a thief, you are sure that your financial information won't be compromised as it would require your biometric authentication or password to get it.Fast and comfortable.All you need to make your payment is your mobile device. Usually, mobile transactions take less than 10 minutes to conclude. However, the only delay with a mobile transaction may be because of network issues. Aside from that, mobile payments are fast.Wide acceptabilityMost retail traders accept mobile payments, especially in the urban areas, even in some rural areas.

Government officials said that the five-point plan has been chalked out based on the four key sources of pollution affecting Delhi--dust, vehicular emissions, burning of waste and pollution from landfills, and stubble burning.Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday announced a five-point plan to provide some relief from the high-pollution levels prevailing over the Capital. Government officials said that the five-point plan has been chalked out based on the four key sources of pollution affecting Delhi--dust, vehicular emissions, burning of waste and pollution from landfills, and stubble burning.|#+|Rai said an emergency meeting was held around 12 noon on Tuesday with government departments and agencies, including the three municipal corporations, the New Delhi Municipal Council and the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to discuss measures to control the four sources of pollution.\u201cWhile we know it is not in our hands to control stubble burning, which is polluting Delhi, we can stop open burning within Delhi and for this, an anti-open burning campaign will be held for a month from November 11. This is a joint campaign in which ten different departments, including the Delhi Pollution Control Committee, three municipal corporations and the DDA, will form their respective teams and monitor open burning. So far, 550 teams have been formed, of which 246 will conduct patrolling at night,\u201d said Rai asking people to report instances of open burning of waste through the Green Delhi app.The minister said to tackle dust, directions have been issued to all departments to start phase two of the anti-dust campaign, that will run from November 12 to December 12. All the departments have been asked to set up an anti-dust cell. \u201cDuring the first phase of the anti-dust campaign that was held from October 7 to 29, DPCC teams inspected around 2,500 sites, of which 450 were fined \u20b91.23 crore for not complying with norms. We are hoping that the second phase will be more successful with all departments joining in. We will also take daily reports from each anti-dust cell to keep a record of the work being done at the ground-level,\u201d said Rai.While directions were earlier issued to deploy 114 water tankers to control dust pollution, Rai said the government\u2019s water sprinkling drive will be intensified by deploying 400 water tankers. Earlier, while only the public works department was carrying out this exercise, now the three civic corporations, the Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (DSIIDC) and the Delhi Cantonment board have also been asked to spray water on Delhi\u2019s roads.The other measures include strict implementation of the directions mentioned in the graded response action plan (Grap), which includes a ban on diesel generator sets, stopping the use of coal-based tandoors at eateries and intensifying the use of public transport services.Directions have also been issued to spray bio-decomposer solution over 4,000 acres of farmland in Delhi. Rai added while the solution--prepared by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute-- has been sprayed on 2,300 acres of farmland, the remaining 1,700 acres will be sprayed with the solution by November 20.Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) said the announcement shows that the government is taking measures to ensure better coordination between different agencies responsible for managing and regulating pollution from local sources. However, she said the government also needs to look at vehicular emissions.\u201cVehicular emissions constitute about 17-40% of Delhi\u2019s PM 2.5 emissions. The government should not wait for the air quality to go beyond severe levels to impose restrictions. Reducing vehicular load will not only impact vehicular emissions but also reduce dust in the air,\u201d she said."}

{"text": "World Diabetes Day 2021: Living with diabetes is not exactly a cakewalk. Apart from regular medication that the doctor has advised, diet and other lifestyle modifications play a major role in management of the metabolic disorder. Managing diabetes in children is all the more challenging as this is the stage where the little ones are growing and developing and any compromises in nutrition could lead to deficiencies, malnutrition or delayed growth and development.While the most common type of diabetes in children is type 1 diabetes, the cases of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents too are on rise. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much glucose stays in the blood.\"Various hospital and clinic-based registries over India suggest that the percentage of type 2 diabetes in children is rising. Type 2 diabetes used to be called adult-onset diabetes. But now it is becoming more common in children and teens, due to more obesity. With type 2 diabetes, the body does not make or use insulin well,\" says Dr. Phulrenu Chauhan, Consultant Endocrinologist at P.D.Hinduja Hospital & MRC.ALSO READ: World Diabetes Day: 10 common diabetes myths bustedThe rise in sedentary lifestyle and faulty eating habits in children are a cause of concern as this may increase their chances of type 2 diabetes.\"Children have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if they are overweight or have obesity, have a family history of diabetes, or are not active,\" says Dr Chauhan.Diet for diabetic children\"Diet therapy, exercise and pharmacotherapy form integral part of diabetes management. Nutrition requirements in children are different from those in adults as they are in growing stage. At the same time children with diabetes are not different from normal children when it comes to nutritional requirements. It becomes even more crucial to meet nutritional needs without compromising with the blood sugar levels,\" says Sweedal Trinidade, HOD Dietary Services at P.D. Hinduja Hospital & MRC, Mahim, Mumbai.With modern therapies like insulin pumps, flexible injection regimes, rigid diet regimes are no longer part of dietary management in children with type 1 diabetes enabling them to lead a more normal lifestyle.\"Customized meal plans considering food preferences, culture, physical activity, schedule are very important to strike a perfect balance between ideal therapeutic diet and occasional allowances to maintain optimum blood sugar levels,\" says Trinidade.Trinidade also suggests what all should be included in diet for children with diabetes:Balanced Diet: It is very important to include all five food groups - Fruits, vegetables, cereals, pulses, milk and milk products so as to maintain variety in food and prevent deficiencies.Carbohydrates: It has direct impact on blood sugar levels and require insulin for absorption. Matching insulin levels with carbohydrate intake is very important to maintain blood sugar levels. Depending upon the complexity it takes two hours for the sugars to enter the blood stream, hence the blood sugars have to be checked two hours post meals.Simple carbohydrates include sugar, jaggery, honey can spike blood sugars and should be avoided. Complex carbohydrates like whole grains, millets, cereals, pulses, vegetables, whole fruits help in slow release of blood sugars and must be preferred to get good glycemic control.Fiber: It should be a crucial part of diet for diabetic children. Fibres help maintain the glycemic index of the food and add to the bulk of the stools. It can be classified into soluble and insoluble fibre. Whole fruits, vegetables, whole grains and psyllium husk are some of the examples.Proteins: Proteins are important for growth and development of the body. Foods rich in proteins and complex carbohydrates help in maintaining the glycemic index of the meals with slow sustained release of glucose. Pulses, meat, fish, chicken, eggs, soya, milk and milk products are loaded with protein and can be included in diet of children with diabetes.Fats: Though it increases the satiety and reduces the glycemic index of the meals, according to studies, consumption of high fat diet in people with type 1 diet is linked with heart disease. Hence saturated and trans fat consumption should be restricted and over all oil consumption should not exceed half liter per person per month.How to do carbohydrate countingIt is the most important part when it comes to blood sugar management in type 1 diabetes* One carbohydrate serving is the choice of food portion that gives 15 gm of carbohydrates. Example: \u00bd vati cooked rice, \u00bd bhakri (jowar, bajra), apple (100g)* Insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio = 1 unit of insulin for 15 grams of carbohydrate.* Insulin to carbohydrate ratio varies from person to person may change from time to time.* Every meal should contain carbohydrate serving that is well balanced with the insulin dose so as to maintain carbohydrate to insulin ratio.* List of regional foods or food preferences need to be discussed with the qualified Dietician who can customize a diet plan, educate about self-monitoring of blood glucose.Mid-meal options for children with diabetesChildren with diabetes should have well balanced meals with complex carbohydrates distributed in all five meals. The diet should be in coordination with insulin dosage prescribed by the doctor.Here are some mid-meal options for diabetic kids by Sweedal Trinidade:Follow more stories on Facebook & Twitter"}

It is only when one parks the car and the guard objects saying \u201cthe students will not be able to gauge the presence of a vehicle at this point\u201d does the realisation dawn that for the 100 students housed in the institute life is littered with unseen hurdles.The coronavirus pandemic only amplified their struggles as the Vocational Rehabilitation Training Centre (VRTC) For The Blind remained closed for eight months. When the institute\u2019s doors finally opened in January this year the strength of students had halved. \u201cWe have only retained 40-50% of our pre-Covid strength. Parents are still wary to send their wards to school,\u201d says, director emeritus Sara Johnson.\u201cFrom 130, we are down to 65 students and are also facing an acute financial crisis. It is primarily younger students who have discontinued classes,\u201d she adds. The centre runs with the help of funds allocated by the Centre and donations. However, Johnson said that the donations dried up after the lockdown was announced. \u201cWith people taking a pay cut, how will they donate?\u201d she says.The Centre, which also houses a hostel, was established in 1971 in a small room at Christian Medical College And Hospital, and shifted to its present location on Haibowal Road opposite Kitchlu Nagar soon after. Around 3,000 visually impaired students have graduated from the school, which offers classes till Class 12, over the last four decades, while 25,000 others have availed vocational training.The centre\u2019s alumni have been gainfully employed as professors in government colleges, assistant workers, clerks and at government-run banks among other avenues.Vocational courses bear the bruntBefore Covid gripped the world, the Centre would run three one-year diplomas in computer training, telephone training and stenography, which were highly sought after as they helped the visually impaired get employed.\u201cWith the advent of mobile phones, the course in telephone training was discontinued, but computer training and stenography courses were quite in vogue, but sincethe centre reopened this year we have been unable to restart the courses due to lack of funds.\u201dJohnson says 50 students had been studying computers, while another 20 were learning stenography and short hand before the lockdown.\u201dWe still get several enquiries, but we need qualified staff and special equipment for the visually challenged, which is not possible under the current circumstances as we have barely managed to pay our staff with the grant we received from the Centre Once donations pick up, perhaps we can resume the courses.\u201d\u2018Was tough social distancing\u2019\u201cWhen the lockdown was imposed last year, the school relied on online classes but it was not the same in the absence of Braille and teachers mostly took verbal classes. Hostellers from other districts and states such as Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, UP, Uttarakhand and New Delhi had to vacate the hostels. However, a couple of orphaned children had nowhere to go and special arrangements were made for them to stay on,\u201d said a teacher.With a staff of 11, the centre is understaffed.However, hope soars in the form of a sweet melody as a Class-5 student, Keshav, sings a classical song, leaving everyone awed. \u201cHe wants to become a singer,\u201d says his teacher, Maya, a former student of the Centre herself.Strength of deaf, dumb students dwindlesA few metres away from the centre for the blind is the school for deaf students. However, it too is complaining of a reduced student strength. \u201cOf the 145 students on roll, only 40 have resumed classes since we reopened after the lockdown,\u201d says general secretary of the school Promod Dada.He blames the increased cost of transportation for the low attendance. \u201cWe are no longer able to provide bus services. Earlier, students from far-flung areas would avail of the service. However, the rising price of fuel has made it untenable to run the service,\u201d he says."}

She completed the rest of her junior college via online classes. So when college reopened on Monday after the Diwali break, she was excited at the thought of meeting her friends in college.\u201cI was hoping to sit in the canteen with my friends, sharing stories of the last few months, while munching sandwiches. But the actual experience was not as exciting as I had expected,\u201d said 17-year-old Masalawala. Like most city colleges, students at KC College sat on alternate benches in class. \u201cWe were not allowed to sit on the same bench. Even after classes were over, we were not allowed to spend time inside the campus. This experience was very new for all of us,\u201d added Masalawala.The excitement of coming back to college after vacations is replete with sharing stories of the holiday gone by. Only this time, the break lasted nearly 19 months, and students, while sitting in the same classroom, had masks on and observed socially distancing rules.\u201cLast year, we had not met our batchmates at all since everything was online, which made it difficult to have any kind of interaction with fellow classmates. We got introduced to many of our batchmates when colleges reopened before the Diwali break, hence meeting everyone again after the vacations was a different kind of excitement,\u201d said 19-year-old Ashwin Mule, second year commerce student at BK Birla College, Kalyan.Staff welcomes studentsThe staff at KC College had sent welcome banners to all their students and was anticipating very few students to show up on Monday, especially, with final year exams and practical sessions currently ongoing. \u201cWe were surprised to see how many first year students made it for class on Monday and how happy they were to sit in their classrooms again, instead of staring at a computer screen,\u201d said Hemlata Bagla, principal of the institute.While not more than 15-20 students physically attended lectures in every class on Monday, the principal hopes that the numbers will increase in the coming days. \u201cThe rule that only fully vaccinated staff and students can attend physical lectures is keeping more students from attending physical lectures. So in the coming weeks we are sure the student attendance will see an upward trend,\u201d added Bagla. In June, the Centre announced that anyone born in 2003 (turning 18 by the end of 2021) will be allowed to book appointments for vaccination.Although the turnout at BK Birla College in Kalyan was fewer compared to when colleges reopened in October, the excitement among teachers and students remained at peak. At the entry gate, school staff welcomed students, conducted temperature checks and provided basic Covid protocols to be followed. \u201cThe circumstances under which we met on Monday was completely different, we could not let ourselves at ease and had to be alert to maintain social distance at all times. But to meet teachers and the school staff who had the same enthusiasm as us was very exciting,\u201d said Rudra Pratap Singh, 20-year-old student of vocational course, BK Birla College.Students were excited to return to offline mode, as during this period, the colleges organise various intercollegiate competitions and festivals. \u201cWe hope at least these are conducted on a small scale. We were deprived of such activities amid the pandemic,\u201d said Vartika Sharma, a third year Arts student. Birla College is currently following the hybrid model and students who have practicals are attending batch wise.\u201cDuring online sessions or in the hybrid mode, often there is a lag in response due to connectivity problems. This makes it difficult to comprehend if the student has understood or they have any doubts. After 19 months of conducting lectures online, this was a welcome change,\u201d said Nitin Barve, professor, BK Birla College, Kalyan."}

Whenever she comes home and gets time, she helps her parents with the vend.\u201cI enjoy doing this even now as this business has been taking care of my family of 10, and I feel proud to have learnt the art of fighting against odds because of this,\u201d said Mumtaz, on Monday, soon after getting selected for India for the upcoming Women\u2019s Junior World Cup, scheduled to be played in South Africa from December 5.\u201cMy struggle keeps reminding me of the tough days, and I am thankful to my parents, who did everything for me to become a hockey player. Now, it\u2019s my time to give them back some pride so I will try to help the team finish on the podium in South Africa, because a medal around my neck will be the biggest gift to my parents,\u201d said Mumtaz (her name means excellent).Forward Mumtaz was forced to play hockey in 2014 by coaching couple Neelam Siddiqui and Rashid Siddiqui at the KD Singh \u2018Babu\u2019 Stadium. While running at the stadium one fine evening, Neelam asked Mumtaz to play hockey and she refused flatly. But after being \u201cforced\u201d on the following day she held the hockey stick and tried some hits.\u201cIt changed my life forever. Madam and her husband literally compelled me to continue playing and they even filled my form for the admission in the hockey hostel in 2014,\u201d recalled Mumtaz. \u201cI was scolded and slapped several times to play correctly, and those lessons are still the best education to me in the game.\u201dMumtaz, who scored 10 goals to help India win the silver medal at the Buenos Aires Youth Olympics in 2018, was so good at dribbling and hitting that she made it to the junior India camp within a year, in 2015, and thereafter, she didn\u2019t look back before being seriously injured in 2019 during junior India tour to Ireland.She also won a bronze medal at the girls\u2019 under-18 Asia Cup in 2016, silver at the Six-Nations Invitational Tournament in 2018, and the coveted gold medal at the Cantor Fitzgerald under-21 International Four-Nations tournament last year.\u201cWhile tackling a ball between the goalposts, I twisted my right knee and it forced me into rehabilitation for almost seven months. I had lost hope but Hockey India took good care of me at Bengaluru,\u201d said Mumtaz, who said the success of the Indian men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams at the Tokyo Olympics has been a great inspiration to her.\u201cNow everyone talks about hockey. Both men and women teams did great at Tokyo and we all draw inspiration from their success,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cNow it\u2019s time for the junior men and women to win medals for the country at the upcoming World Cups. That would be the real tribute to the success of our seniors.\u201dMumtaz\u2019s father Hafeez was over the moon when came to know about his daughter\u2019s selection for the World Cup. \u201cIt\u2019s all God\u2019s grace and Mumtaz\u2019s hard work. I am really proud of her,\u201d he said on Monday.His family had to stay without food for some time to support Mumtaz\u2019s dream of playing hockey, Hafeez reminisced. \u201cWe are hoping for \u2018acche din\u2019 (good days) soon as Mumtaz\u2019s success at the junior level will help her make it into the senior side,\u201d said her sister, Farah, who is the brain behind Mumtaz\u2019s entry into the game.\u201cHer (Mumtaz\u2019s) passion for sport is something different. She doesn\u2019t skip her training even today when she is in Lucknow on a vacation,\u201d said her coach Neelam."}
{"text": "The Union government on Monday amended its Fundamental Rules (FR) to bring them in line with two ordinances promulgated on Sunday to give the chiefs of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) extended terms of up to five years.The overarching set of rules listed in the government\u2019s FR apply to all civilian officers, and cover the entire gamut of their in-service and post-retirement work scenarios, making it possible for the government to ensure continuity over much of its remaining term.According to the notification issued on Monday, the rules now allow the central government to give extension in \u201cpublic interest\u201d to the defence secretary, home secretary, director of Intelligence Bureau (IB), Secretary of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and directors of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED), on a case-to-case basis, subject to the condition that the total term of such secretaries or directors does not exceed two years or the period provided in the respective act or rules made thereunder, under which their appointments are made\u201d.To be sure, the existing FR already provided for a maximum two-year extension to the home, foreign and defence secretaries, and the CBI, R&AW and IB chiefs.Under the newly promulgated ordinances, CBI and ED chiefs are eligible for a maximum of five-year total tenures, and the changes to the FR take that into account.The notification issued on Monday, however, excluded the post of foreign secretary from the ambit of the exceptions to the superannuation rules, which otherwise say that all officers must retire at the age of 60. It was not clear at the time of going to print why this change was effected.The post of foreign secretary was included in the Fundamental Rules following a proposal cleared by the Union Cabinet in December 2010 \u201cin view of the assignment of Foreign Secretary having increasingly acquired critical dimensions from the national security and strategic perspective, and the need to ensure continuity and swiftness in the decision-making process\u201d.Opposition parties on Monday raised objections over the government taking ordinance route to extend the tenures of CBI and ED directors, and then notifying the changes, just 15 days ahead of a Parliament session.Abhishek Singhvi, senior Congress MP and legal expert, dubbed the move \u201cillegal\u201d and a bid to keep the sleuths on a leash.\u201cKeeping you on a leash, watching you and giving you incremental, partial, piecemeal extensions, because that allows me to be a control freak over you, that allows me to control, because I will say, next time please watch out, your provision in coming again after one year. You better behave into everything I tell you because then only you will get an extension,\u201d Singhvi said, questioning the ordinance push ahead of the winter session.CPIM general secretary Sitaram Yechury demanded scrapping of the two ordinances.\u201cPromulgation of 2 ordinances extending term of ED & CBI directors to 5 years on the eve of winter session of parliament is reprehensible. It\u2019s against SC directions. CBI & ED are made to function as political arm of BJP. Rescind these ordinances,\u201d said Yechury.There was no response from ministry of home affairs and Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) on the issue.The Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021 promulgated on Sunday, said the tenure of the CBI director can be extended up to one year at a time, provided \u201cthat no such extension shall be granted after the completion of a period of five years in total including the period mentioned in the initial appointment\u201d.According to the Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021, which also came into effect on Sunday, the tenure of ED chief can be extended up to one year at a time \u201cprovided further that no such extension shall be granted after the completion of a period of five years in total including the period mentioned in the initial appointment\u201d.The directors of CBI and ED have a normal fixed tenure of two years each.The tenure of ED chief Sanjay Kumar Mishra is due to end on Wednesday, and CBI chief Subodh Kumar Jaiswal\u2019s tenure ends in May 2023."}

The Shivsrushti is located at Ambegaon; some works have been completed while many others remain incomplete due to financial problems,\u201d Balkawde said.Late Babasaheb Purandare used the income received from the sale of tickets of his mega play, \u201cJanta Raja\u201d to create Shivsrushti where both scholars and commoners would get all the information about Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the Maratha Empire. He purchased 27 acre land at Ambegaon through the Maharaja Shivchhatrapati Pratishthan under the Shiv Sena government led by the then chief minister Manohar Joshi.\u201cBabasaheb spent Rs25 crore from his own pocket (sale of tickets of \u2018Janta Raja\u2019) on the project. However, a lot more money was required and Babasaheb tried to raise it. The Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (RSS) generated around Rs50 crore for the project. Even the state government promised some money but handed over to him Rs5 crore under the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis,\u201d Balkawde said.\u201cAround Rs80 crore has already been spent on the project but if we want to pay real tribute to Babasaheb, we need to complete this project which will be a world attraction in future,\u201d Balkawde added.The then BJP government under chief minister Devendra Fadnavis granted \u201cmega project\u201d status to Shivsrushti which created controversy at the time as there were two Shivsrushtis planned in the city \u2013 one by Babasaheb\u2019s trust and the other by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).What is Shivsrushti?Late Babasaheb Purandare travelled all over the world and saw various memorials and parks following which he questioned why there was no such memorial dedicated to Shivaji Maharaj, where citizens would get all the information about the Maratha warrior-king and his various pursuits. It was a dream and Babasaheb began pursuing it, starting with the purchase of land at Ambegaon and meetings with various historians, architects and people from all walks of life.Today, the Sarkarwada building has been completed and even the replica of the Bhavani Mata temple located at Pratapgad is near complete. Babasaheb wanted to display how Shivaji Maharaj fought, which is why one tank was proposed within the memorial. He wanted the library located within the memorial premises to house all the books on Shivaji Maharaj so that citizens and students could refer to them whenever needed. He planned to erect a replica of Raigad hall (darbar) where Shivaji Maharaj pronounced his accession as Maharaj."}

{"text": "The Centre has decided to reopen the Kartarpur Corridor from Wednesday, which connects the Indian border with Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan, union home minister Amit Shah has announced.The visa-free 4.7km corridor was shut last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.In a series of tweets, Amit Shah said reopening the Kartarpur Corridor will benefit a large numbers of Sikh pilgrims.\u201cThis decision reflects the immense reverence of the Modi government towards Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji and our Sikh community. The nation is all set to celebrate the Prakash Utsav of Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji on November 19, and I am sure PM Narendra Modi government\u2019s decision to reopen the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor will further boost the joy and happiness across the country,\u201d the home minister tweeted.The Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s (BJP) leaders in Punjab met President Ram Nath Kovind and Amit Shah on Monday, requesting that the corridor be reopened.A delegation from the BJP\u2019s Punjab unit also met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week, seeking his intervention over the reopening of the corridor, which has been closed since March 16, 2020 when Indian government suspended all travel to and from Pakistan due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Also Read: Captain thanks Modi for \u2018timely opening\u2019 of Kartarpur Sahib corridorPunjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, too, had written to Modi and Shah, requesting that the Kartarpur Corridor be reopened.The proposal for the special corridor was first pitched back in 1999 by former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his then Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif as part of the Delhi-Lahore bus diplomacy.Sikh pilgrims from India earlier used to take a bus to Lahore to eventually get to Kartarpur, which made the journey almost 125km long.The Kartarpur Corridor was inaugurated on November 9, 2019 to mark the 550th \u201cParkash Guruparab (birth anniversary)\u201d of Guru Nanak.It has been touted by the BJP as one of the many accomplishments of the Modi government, and it recently featured at the party\u2019s national executive committee meeting.Former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh thanked Modi and Shah for their decision to reopen the corridor. \u201cIt will provide a chance to thousands of devotees to pay obeisance at the holy shrine on the occasion of Guru Purab of Guru Nanak Dev ji,\u201d Singh tweeted.As reported by HT in March 2020, over 59,000 pilgrims visited the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur, Pakistan since the opening of the Kartarpur Corridor in November 2019 until March 8 last year, according to data compiled at the integrated check post set up at Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur.The government said last Thursday that it expects Pakistan to allow a visit this month by a group of 1,500 pilgrims on the occasion of \u201cGuruparab\u201d or the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak.\u201cIn view of the significance of Guruparab and sentiments associated with it, it has been decided that a \u2018jatha\u2019 of around 1,500 pilgrims will visit Pakistan from November 17-26 via the Attari-Wagah integrated check post,\u201d external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said on Thursday.Earlier, in June this year, Pakistan had denied permission for visits - on the occasion of the martyrdom day of Guru Arjan Dev and on the death anniversary of Maharaja Ranjit Singh - even though both occasions were covered under the 1974 bilateral protocol on visits to religious shrines."}
{"text": "Less than 72 hours after New Zealand endured the heartbreak of defeat against Australia in the T20 World Cup final in Dubai\u2014barely having had time to process their loss\u2014the Black Caps will be turning out at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Wednesday for the first of three T20Is against India. The cricket caravan will then head to Ranchi and Kolkata for T20Is before finishing with two Tests in Kanpur and Mumbai.The timing of this bilateral series would have got more bizarre if India too had made the title showdown on Sunday. That this series was listed in the calendar so soon after the World Cup final suggests that not enough consideration is being shown to the plight of the players.Not surprisingly, NZ skipper Kane Williamson has chosen to skip the T20Is before getting back on the treadmill for the Tests. Expect a few more of the Kiwi stars to sit out while the likes of Kyle Jamieson, Todd Astle and Mark Chapman, all of whom had limited game-time during the ICC event, may get a run. The luxury of rest isn\u2019t available to Tim Southee at the moment though. He has been named captain for the T20I series and, unlike fellow seamer Trent Boult, will stay back for the Tests too.SLIGHTLY BETTER OFFIndia\u2019s early exit meant they have had a little more time than their Kiwi counterparts, but nine days\u2014their last game was on November 8\u2014isn\u2019t all that much either. Particularly when you consider the taxing schedule that they have had to endure since the start of the Test series against England in August. That series, which ended prematurely on September 10 with the fifth Test postponed to next year, was immediately followed by IPL from September 19 to October 15.Nine days later, the Indian players were lining up for their T20 WC opener against no less than arch-rivals Pakistan. Since IPL began, their movement has been monitored under a strict bio-bubble as well.Given India\u2019s resources and financial muscle, though, the relentless scheduling doesn\u2019t always invoke sympathy even if Jasprit Bumrah and now former bowling coach Bharat Arun have cited it as a possible factor in the performance. What is the solution then?Some have suggested that separate teams for separate formats is the way forward for Indian cricket, especially given the talent pool. When India were playing the Test series in England, for instance, another team was simultaneously taking on Sri Lanka in a limited-overs series.But Rahul Dravid, who was in charge of the team in Sri Lanka, shot the idea down in his first press conference as full-time India coach. Simply put, he would still want players of the calibre of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Bumrah to be playing all three formats.\u201cWe are not at that point where we are looking at separate teams for separate formats. I would certainly want Rohit to be playing all the three formats for us\u2026 Of course, there are certain individuals who play particular formats of the game. We see that happening with most teams. Obviously, in times like this, we need to be in conversation with the players. The players\u2019 physical and mental health is the most important thing. I would like to work with them. I would like to ensure that whenever they are playing, we have them fresh and fully switched on,\u201d the former India captain said.NON-STOP PLAYINGThe upcoming calendar is no less onerous on the players. Once the New Zealand series ends on December 7, the Test contingent will sit on a plane and embark on a tour of South Africa for three Tests. And the gap between the two assignments? Ten days!It is a non-stop affair thereafter with the Indian players caught in the heat of battle at least till the tour of England in July next year.Amidst all this, there is also the challenge of putting right their recent record in ICC events. The Indians have been excellent in bilateral contests in the last couple of years, but as Dravid knows after the 2007 ODI World Cup debacle, teams are often judged by how they stack up in marquee events.The T20 World Cup will again be held this time next year in Australia while 2023 has in store both the ODI World Cup and the World Test Championship final.\u201cWe will not prioritise any one format at all. All three formats are critically important for us, there will be no let-up on how we prepare and plan for any of the three formats. We have three ICC events and we need to prepare for those events,\u201d Dravid added.Perhaps, India can take a cue from New Zealand, who are Test champions as well as runners-up in the ODI and T20I formats in the last three years. Life under the bubble, Southee admitted though, is taking a heavy toll on them too.\u201cWith what\u2019s happened in the world in the last couple of years, it\u2019s made things a lot tougher with bubbles and quarantines. It does take its toll. A few players have been in a number of bubbles for long periods of time, so it does weigh you down after a while. So, hopefully, we don\u2019t have to deal with bubbles for too much longer,\u201d the stand-in NZ skipper said."}

Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday announced the Centre\u2019s decision to reopen the visa-free 4.7-km corridor that connects Dera Baba Nanak Sahib gurdwara on the Indian side with Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, the final resting place of the first Sikh Guru.On Thursday, another group of pilgrims, including Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi along with other Congress MLAs will visit Kartarpur. It was not confirmed whether Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu will also be part of the group. \u201cThe list is yet to be finalised, but we think around 100 people will go on Thursday,\u201d said a customs official.A delegation of BJP leaders will also visit the historic gurdwara via the corridor on Thursday.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is also taking a delegation to pay obeisance at Kartarpur on Friday. AAP senior leader Harpal Singh Cheema said, \u201cAll of our MLAs led by party state president Bhagwant Mann will go to Kartarpur on Friday. We are waiting for the clearance.\u201dThe Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has also announced to take a delegation to Kartarpur on Friday on the 552nd birth anniversary of Guru Nanak. The delegation will be headed by gurdwara body chief Jagir Kaur. \u201cWe are finalising the list of pilgrims who will be part of the SGPC jatha. The list will be sent to the Centre,\u201d said an SGPC spokesperson.LPAI manager Sukhdev Singh said they have made adequate arrangements for hassle-free journey of pilgrims at the Dera Baba Nanak ICP."}
{"text": "The Supreme Court on Thursday asked former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh to disclose his whereabouts while making it clear that the court would not entertain his petition for protection against arrest in an alleged extortion case until his location is known.Singh (56), the second most senior Indian Police Service (IPS) serving officer in Maharashtra, was declared a proclaimed offender by a Mumbai court on Wednesday after he remained elusive since March this year and did not show up before the trial court despite several notices and warrants issued against him.Taking up his petition, a top court bench, headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, was emphatic that Singh\u2019s petition could be considered only after he comes clear on his whereabouts. It also noted that Singh\u2019s petition in the top court, filed in September against the Bombay high court\u2019s refusal to give him pre-arrest bail, was moved through a power of attorney holder and did not carry his signature.\u201cYour petition has been filed by your power of attorney holder. Where are you? Are you in the country or outside the country? We could be wrong but if you are somewhere abroad and waiting for Supreme Court orders, how can we give it?\u201d the bench, which also comprised justice MM Sundresh, asked senior advocate Puneet Bali, who appeared for Singh.Bali said that the counsel who filed the petition could answer the court\u2019s poser but the filing lawyer, Natasha Vinayak, could only answer that the petition has been filed through Singh\u2019s power of attorney holder and that she would have to check about Singh\u2019s whereabouts.On his part, Bali said: \u201cIf I (Singh) am allowed to breathe, I can get out of the hole.\u201dDissatisfied with the response, the bench replied: \u201cYou are seeking a protection order but you have not joined any investigation. If you are sitting abroad and approaching the court...if the court gives a favourable order, then only you will come back. We cannot pass an order here while you are in a foreign country.\u201d\u201cNo protection, no hearing till we have the answer to the question -- where are you?\u201d emphasised the bench, refusing to hear Singh\u2019s lawyer until the former Mumbai Police chief\u2019s location is disclosed.Bali and Vinayak sought for time till Monday to come back with the answer to the court\u2019s query. The case was then adjourned for Monday next week.The bench was hearing a plea against a September 16 judgment of the Bombay high court which had dismissed the petition filed by Singh challenging two preliminary inquiries initiated against him by the Maharashtra government.As he remained absconding for several weeks, Mumbai\u2019s additional chief metropolitan magistrate court declared Singh a proclaimed offender on Wednesday, allowing an application filed by Mumbai Police\u2019s crime branch. The crime branch is investigating an August 20 extortion case registered in Goregaon in northwest Mumbai. The FIR named Singh, dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze and civilians \u2014 Sumeet Singh, Alpesh Patel, Vinay Ramnarayan Singh aka Bablu and Riyaz Bhati \u2014 for extortion.The complainant, restaurateur Bimal Agarwal, alleged that the accused extorted \u20b911.92 lakh from him by threatening to register cases against two of his outlets \u2013 Boho Restaurant and BCB Bar. Once it took over the investigation, the crime branch arrested Vaze, Sumeet Singh and Alpesh Patel.No SIT, no CBI\u2019s inquiry report for Anil Deshmukh: SCThe Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed a petition filed by former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, seeking a direction to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to produce its inquiry reports relating to the corruption case filed against him.\u201cShould we entertain this petition just because this person has been a minister? There has to be something extraordinary warranting an interference by this court in an ongoing investigation,\u201d the bench, led by justice Kaul, told senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for Deshmukh.Sibal argued that Deshmukh\u2019s only remedy was before the apex court since CBI in April informed the bench that the preliminary investigation has disclosed commission of serious offences against Deshmukh in the corruption case. The senior counsel referred to recent media reports that claimed a clean chit to Deskhmukh in this case.The bench, however, asked Sibal if media reports alone could be relied upon by the court to entertain a petition. It dismissed Deshmukh\u2019s petition, asking him to approach a court of competent jurisdiction.During the hearing, Sibal also complained that the court, while refusing to entertain Deshmukh\u2019s petition against CBI\u2019s preliminary investigation in April, cited former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh\u2019s allegations but the senior police officer was now absconding.\u201cIt is unfortunate that people occupying important positions show no confidence in the system,\u201d retorted the bench.Deshmukh has been in jail since November 2 after he was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), almost six months after the agency first registered a case against him for obtaining illegal gratification from bar owners in Mumbai when the minister was in office.In his petition before the Supreme Court, Deshmukh also asked for constitution of a special investigation team (SIT) for a \u201cfair and independent\u201d probe into corruption and bribery charges against him."}

We have been seeking the repeal since these laws were passed last year. The Union government has not spoken to us now, they should have. The government has to go to Parliament to formally repeal the laws. The SKM will meet and work out the further course of action. There are several issues attached to the protest such as many lives of protesting farmers being lost. They had to face cases from the government, we need answers on that, too.\u201d"}

{"text": "Cryptocurrency watchers in India, who have for months now expressed apprehensions over a blanket ban in India against digital tokens, can likely rest easy as the central government is set to introduce a bill in the forthcoming winter session of Parliament which, if passed, will ban only the \u2018private\u2019 cryptocurrencies. First thing's first \u2013 investors trading in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the likes may breathe a sigh of relief as these are public blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, which offer a degree of anonymity but are markedly different from what is known as private cryptocurrency, which could refer to Monero, Dash, and others of its sort.Also Read | Cryptocurrency crash: Bitcoin, Ethereum fall in value. Here are possible causes\u2018Public\u2019 vs \u2018private\u2019 cryptocurrencyAlthough the definition of what exactly constitutes as \u2018private\u2019 cryptocurrency has not yet been clarified by the central government yet, it is likely that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto tokens of the sort won't be banned since these are based on public blockchain networks, which mean transactions made using these networks are traceable while still providing a degree of anonymity to users.Private cryptocurrency, on the other hand, could refer to Monero, Dash, and the likes \u2013 which, although built on public blockchains, conceal the transaction information to offer privacy to users. while Bitcoin offers anonymity, Monero offers privacy and is, hence, a private token.Is a blanket ban possible?Since a cryptocurrency, in essence, lacks any inherent value or liquidity, it might prove difficult to actually ban the tokens \u2013 which could be called an asset, a commodity, a currency, or even a security. Millions of people around the world could, theoretically, hold such a currency \u2013 which are basically pieces of code that can't be \u2018banned\u2019 \u2013 and still agree to use it as a medium of exchange, which will then lend it value.Transferring cryptocurrencies from one wallet to another is essentially no different from sharing files from one computer to another, so a regulatory ban might not take away people's ability to send cryptocurrencies to each other.Also Read | \u2018Cryptocurrency cannot be stopped but must be regulated\u2019, concludes Parliamentary Standing CommitteeHowever, there are always ways for governments to create barriers to transactions and entry of such digital tokens. Since the majority of investors trade on crypto exchanges, banning these platforms is likely to take away a chunk of mainstream cryptocurrency users who have, perhaps, not yet delved into the technical world of creating crypto wallets and so on.A blanket ban would force crypto exchanges to stop operations in India. One of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges, Huobi, had to do the same when China issued a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies earlier this year in September. The exchange\u2019s founder told the Financial Times on November 8 that its revenues from Chinese users during the September to December quarter would be zero.A policy expert, familiar with the developments on the government end, told HT's sister publication Livemint that there are \u201ctwo factions\u201d within the government \u2013 one that wants to ban cryptos and one that wants to regulate it. \u201cBut since the regulatory scenario wasn\u2019t clear, the first group is the one that\u2019s coming out on top,\u201d the person was quoted as saying. \u201cThe government may pass a money bill if it wants, which will be cleared in 14 days. Or they could also do an ordinance, which will be faster.\u201dMeanwhile, Nischal Shetty, the CEO of WazirX \u2013 India\u2019s largest crypto exchange platform \u2013 tweeted: \u201cThe crypto regulation bill has been listed for the winter session.

{"text": "Germany passed the threshold of 100,000 Covid-19 deaths, with the latest wave of the pandemic still pushing new infections higher and hospitals in some hotspots under severe pressure.Since the pandemic took hold at the beginning of last year, 100,119 people have died from the virus, according to the latest data from the RKI public-health institute. The number roughly equals the population of mid-sized German cities like Erlangen or Guetersloh, the home towns of Siemens Healthineers AG and media firm Bertelsmann SE respectively.Germany\u2019s death toll is still lower than in the UK, France or Italy, which each passed 100,000 some time ago. The US has recorded the most deaths with more than 770,000, following by Brazil with over 610,000, according to the Bloomberg Covid-19 Tracker.The number of daily fatalities in Germany is only about a fifth of the level seen last winter, with about 68% of the population fully vaccinated against the disease.Germany\u2019s hospitals are nonetheless becoming increasingly overwhelmed in some regions, and the government\u2019s latest measures have yet to show a tangible effect.Chancellor Angela Merkel and regional leaders agreed last week to restrict access to restaurants, bars and public events for unvaccinated people in hard-hit areas, and the curbs are taking effect across most of the country.With infections climbing further and authorities slow to act amid a change in power, experts warn that another lockdown like in neighboring Austria could become unavoidable, inflicting more damage on Europe\u2019s biggest economy and delaying its recovery.The prospect of tighter restrictions ahead of the Christmas season is \u201ca catastrophe,\u201d according to Marc Tenbieg from lobby group Deutscher Mittelstands-Bund, which represents the small and medium-sized companies that make up the backbone of the German economy.The association backs curbs to fight the pandemic, Tenbieg said, though he criticized political leaders for reacting \u201cfar too late.\u201d"}
{"text": "Tim Paine is stepping away from cricket for an \"indefinite mental health break\", his manager said on Friday, leaving Australia's Ashes preparations in disarray a week after the wicketkeeper's resignation from the captaincy.Paine was due to play for Tasmania in a domestic one-day match in Hobart on Friday in the lead up to the first Ashes test in Brisbane on Dec. 8, but will be unavailable for the \"foreseeable future\", the state's cricket association said.\"Confirming that @tdpaine36 is stepping away from cricket for an indefinite mental health break,\" Paine's manager James Henderson wrote in a social media post. \"We are extremely concerned for his and (wife) Bonnie\u2019s well-being and will be making no further comment at this time.\"Speculation over Paine's place in the test team has been rife since his resignation over revelations that he was investigated for sending sexually explicit text messages to a female former Cricket Tasmania (CT) staffer four years ago.Paine, who married Bonnie in 2016 and has children with her, was cleared after a 2018 probe by CT and national board Cricket Australia (CA) but stepped down last Friday, saying he did not want his captaincy to be a distraction during the Ashes. He said he would remain available for selection, though selectors chairman George Bailey confirmed Paine was no lock for the Ashes while coming back from neck surgery.Bailey also said he would recuse himself from the decision to select Paine, a close friend and business partner, if there was contention on the selection panel. Cricket Australia boss Nick Hockley said Paine had advised the board of his decision to step away from the game.\"We recognise that this is an incredibly difficult time for Tim and his family and are committed to supporting them,\" Hockley said in a statement. \"We respect and understand Tim\u2019s decision to have a break at this time to focus on his and his family\u2019s well-being.\"Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting said this week that Paine's selection against England would still prove distracting for the team. Paine's team mates, including spinner Nathan Lyon, said they hoped he would remain in the side.Paine, who was the only specialist wicketkeeper named in Australia's 15-man Ashes squad, is likely to be replaced by experienced white ball wicketkeeper Alex Carey or Josh Inglis, both of whom were named in the recent Australia 'A' squad.Relinquishing his place could spell the end of 36-year-old Paine's international career after 35 tests. His resignation from the captaincy triggered acrimony between Cricket Tasmania and CA, with the state federation accusing the national board of hanging Paine out to dry.CA chairman Richard Freudenstein said last week his current board would not have endorsed Paine as captain if presented with the same circumstances as the previous board in 2018. Australia are expected to name fast bowler Pat Cummins as captain in coming days."}
{"text": "Given the current sentiment in the country where the plight of farmers has evoked extreme reactions, Antim: The Final Truth somewhat touches upon that chord and tries to makes a strong point. An official adaptation of the hit Marathi film Mulshi Pattern, this Mahesh Manjrekar directorial adds a whole lot of Bollywood masala to make it a wholesome entertainer but not without over-the-top drama and loud action sequences.Set on the premise of age-old ordeal of farmers losing their land to mafias, Antim shows its repercussions when Rahul (Aayush Sharma), a jobless son of a farmer turns into one of the most dreaded gangsters who joins hands with land mafias of Pune to fight injustice after his father is ripped off his land. Will he manage to win back all that he lost in this journey or will he face the wrath of his own wrong doings? This narrative that keeps you on the edge for most of the time.The first half of the film creates quite an engaging build-up, setting the right tone for characters. But I was taken aback with how the second half took a nosedive. The story gets predictable and starts to lose grip. In no time, everyone is seen killing each other, not adding anything much to the plot but definitely taking the raw action a notch higher. In between all this, a lavani item song by Waluscha D'Souza and a Ganpati song featuring Varun Dhawan are quite abruptly and forcefully wedged in.What stands out in the film is Aayush Sharma's transformation with a well sculpted body. After a passable debut with Loveyatri, Aayush has evidently worked hard to get into the skin of this ruthless and deadly goon anyone would resent with a passion. He triggers anger in you, makes you want to hate him, and then there are shades in Rahul's character that evoke empathy, too. He doesn't hide behind Salman's shadow and instead takes him head on in the film with his body language and on-point expressions.Antim is different from any other Salman Khan film and sees him in a restrained performance as Sikh cop, Rajveer Singh. Also, it's quite unlike his Robinhood in Dabangg or Radhe in Wanted.Though Salman and Aayush are at loggerheads, it's not the usual cat and mouse chase between a good cop and the bad guy. However, what's common in Antim and all other action thrillers we see is heavyweight dialogues, bloody punches, gunshots and men covered in blood flying in the air like dust particles. In this department, Antim is no different.Also read: Satyameva Jayate 2 movie review: John Abraham's triple role is three headaches rolled up in one filmAlso, there's a big line-up of supporting actors including Upendra Limaye, Nikiten Dheer, Jisshu Sengupta, Sayaji Shinde, but at times, you feel they are there to only to add needless subplots and fights. Marathi actor Sachin Khedekar as Rahul's father Sakharam is the best out of this lot. He delivers a convincing performance and brings in varied emotions while dealing with his son.In this heavily male-dominated script, there's also Mahima Makhwana as Manda, making her film debut. As Aayush's love interest, she has hardly anything to bring to the table. Even their chemistry doesn't add any sparks onscreen. Talking of female characters, there's also Aayush's mother and sister, who don't get more than two lines to speak in a couple of scenes.Overall, the film has what it takes to be a mass entertainer but had it been less preachy and stuck to the gangster drama plot without emotional tropes, it could have been more impactful. Watch it to enjoy Aayush and Salman both in new avatars.Antim: The Final TruthDirector: Mahesh ManjrekarCast: Salman Khan, Aayush Sharma"}

The prime minister urged citizens to be cautious while asking states to move quickly to take precautionary measures and remain vigilant.The new strain of coronavirus was first identified in South Africa.The Union health ministry has also directed states and union territories to begin rigorous screening and testing of all international travellers coming from or transiting through countries including Botswana, South Africa and Hong Kong which have reported cases of the new variant.Two South African returnees in Bengaluru on Friday tested positive for the viral infection and their samples sent for further tests to determine the exact variant, \u00a0a Karnataka state official had told news agency PTI.Meanwhile, the World Health Organization, which already termed omicron as a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d, also asked countries in the southeast Asian region to scale up surveillance, strengthen public health and social measures, and enhance vaccination coverage."}
{"text": "Winter is the best time to strengthen your immunity as during this time green leafy vegetables are abundant from spinach (palak), amarnath (chaulai), fenugreek (methi), chenopodium album (bathua) to moringa (sahjan). As the new heavily mutated Covid variant of concern Omicron triggers panic among people, it is best to boost your immunity naturally by eating a healthy and balanced diet.Green vegetables are a powerhouse of nutrients, loaded with soluble and insoluble fibre, vitamins and minerals like iron, folic acid, calcium, potassium, phosphorous and magnesium. They not only boost your immunity against seasonal infections, but also provide you protection from cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and constipation.Why Sarson Ka Saag is a must-have during winter seasonMustard greens or Sarson is one of the winter vegetables that must be consumed for the presence of plant compounds called glucosinolates, one of the most researched ingredients for its anticancer activity and DNA protection, says Luke Coutinho, Holistic Lifestyle Coach - Integrative and Lifestyle Medicine and Founder of YouCare - All about YOU by Luke Coutinho.ALSO READ: Gorge on palak paneer or palak paratha this winter for amazing health benefits\"This pungent cruciferous wintergreen is primarily available in the winter season and is a star ingredient in Sarson ka saag, a popular vegetarian winter delicacy from northern India,\" he says.Another vegetable that the lifestyle coach recommends is Spinach. Palak or spinach, the most common kind of green leafy vegetable, is a rich source of vitamin K, C, and D, dietary fibre, iron, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, and plenty of antioxidants like quercetin and kaempferol. One of the antioxidants in spinach, called lutein, has also been shown to reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration, a degenerative condition that can blur vision,\" says Coutinho.It is also important for children to benefit from the nutritional content of green vegetables, but many of them are picky eaters and it is imperative to make the greens interesting for them to eat. With schools reopening parents can get creative and rustle out some innovative tiffin dishes for their kids using greens. If your kid isn't a fan of sabzis and curries, you can include green vegetables in their diet in following ways suggested by Coutinho.* Parathas and theplas: While some children complain of the bitter taste of methi or fenugreek and do not like to have palak-paneer, adding these veggies to the dough and making paratha, puri or theplas out of it will make them taste good.* Patties and tikkis: You can also sneak the greens in potato or sweet potato fillings in patties or tikkis.* Sun dry and powder them: This powder can be used in doughs, raitas, dals, smoothies. You can also add them to rice preparations like pulaos and biryanis.* Dumplings: Try filling them in dumplings and chances are your kid will keep asking for more.* Idli or dosa: It can also be mixed in idli or dosa batter. Another way is to add it to dough and bake crackers out of it.Soups and brothes: Winters are also about soups and broths. The greens would make a good addition to the soups.While these green vegetables are full of nutrients it is important to follow good hygiene practices while cooking them as the leaves can carry the risk of stomach infection if not washed well.\"Also, if it does not suit you, do not eat them. If you have a kidney condition or an extremely weak gut, be mindful of its consumption. And most importantly, just because it is healthy, do not overdo it,\" suggests Coutinho.Follow more stories on Facebook & Twitter"}

{"text": "The World Health Organization is working with researchers around the globe to better understand the new coronavirus variant after health experts in South Africa, where omicron was first detected, said it appeared to cause only mild symptoms.There\u2019s no information to suggest that symptoms associated with omicron differ from those caused by other variants, the Geneva-based WHO cautioned Sunday. Some of the earliest reported infections occurred among college students who are more likely to experience less severe illness from Covid-19, and understanding the level of severity of the new strain \u201cwill take days to several weeks,\u201d the WHO said.\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough data to determine vaccine effectiveness against omicron or disease severity, so any claims about either at this stage are not evidence-based,\u201d said Raina MacIntyre, professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. \u201cSo far, the virus has not mutated to become less severe -- in fact the opposite.\u201dAlso read | Risk related to Covid variant Omicron 'very high', warns WHOGovernments around the world are banning travelers from South Africa and nearby countries amid fears the new \u201cvariant of concern\u201d could evade vaccines, exacerbate Covid surges and frustrate efforts to reopen economies. While news of the new variant wreaked havoc in global markets on Friday, trading in Asia Monday indicated investors were waiting for more clarity, as scientists from the U.S. to Asia work to understand more about omicron\u2019s makeup, its transmissibility, and how lethal it is compared with other strains.The U.K. government will convene an urgent meeting of Group of Seven health ministers Monday to discuss the latest developments, according to the country\u2019s Department of Health. In the U.S., President Joe Biden will also give an update on Monday, the White House said.Omicron was first detected earlier this month. It\u2019s characterized by some 30 or more genetic changes, half of which are in the receptor binding domain -- the part of the spike protein used to bind to human ACE-2, which is the enzyme the coronavirus targets to enter cells and cause an infection. Mutations there can make the spike protein less recognizable to the antibodies produced in response to vaccination or a natural infection.Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, called symptoms associated with the variant at this point \u201cdifferent and so mild\u201d compared with others she\u2019s treated in recent months.Coetzee, who first spotted what turned out to be the new variant, told the U.K.\u2019s Telegraph newspaper that a number of healthy young men turned up at her clinic \u201cfeeling so tired.\u201d About half were unvaccinated.\u201cWhat we are seeing clinically in South Africa and remember, I\u2019m at the epicenter, that\u2019s where I\u2019m practicing, is extremely mild,\u201d she said Sunday on the BBC\u2019s \u201cAndrew Marr Show.\u201dClick here to know more about the Omicron Covid-19 variant\u201cWe haven\u2019t admitted anyone\u201d to the hospital with the new variant, she said. \u201cI spoke to other colleagues of mine, the same picture.\u201dAsked if authorities around the world were panicking unnecessarily, Coetzee said, \u201cYes, at this stage I would say definitely. Two weeks from now on maybe we will say something different.\u201dExperts elsewhere, however, followed the WHO in urging caution.Richard Lessells, an infectious-diseases physician at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, said a rapid understanding of disease severity caused by omicron is critical, but it\u2019s too early for reliable data. The time it takes for infections to progress to severe disease or hospitalization means omicron\u2019s impact may not be apparent for a few more weeks.\u2018Be Cautious\u2019\u201cObservations from clinicians on the ground are always important, and we lean heavily on them, but we need to be cautious about jumping on early reports that all cases with this variant are mild,\u201d Lessells said in a Twitter post Sunday.The variant\u2019s genome contains \u201csome concerning elements,\u201d said Stephen Goldstein, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Their affect on vaccine effectiveness should be better known in the next couple of weeks, he said. Omicron also has some mutations near the so-called furin cleavage site of the spike protein that are associated with the increased transmissibility of both the alpha and delta variants.\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see cases pop up in other parts of the world, so it appears to be spreading quite quickly, which leads to concerns that it may be even more transmissible than delta, but it really is too soon to say,\u201d Goldstein said in a Zoom interview. Any advantage omicron has may become clearer if it starts spreading in the U.S. and parts of Europe already battling delta-fueled epidemics, he said.Also read | Omicron: Sisodia says can\u2019t lower guard, Centre, states to monitor variantThe average number of daily cases in South Africa jumped to about 1,600 last week from about 500 the previous week and 275 infections in the week before that, President Cyril Ramaphosa said Sunday. The proportion of Covid tests coming back positive jumped to 9% from about 2% in less than a week. Only 36% of adults in South Africa are fully vaccinated.Barry Schoub, chairman of South Africa\u2019s Ministerial Advisory Committee on Vaccines, said there\u2019s been no real uptick in hospitalizations. \u201cThe cases that have occurred so far have all been mild cases, mild-to-moderate cases, and that\u2019s a good sign,\u201d Schoub told Sky News on Sunday, adding that it was still early days and nothing was certain yet.No unusual symptoms have been reported following infection with omicron and, as with other variants, some individuals are asymptomatic, South Africa\u2019s National Institute for Communicable Diseases said Friday.Also read | No case of Omicron variant in India, 2 clusters under investigation, says govtAsymptomatic CasesTwo omicron cases detected in Australia and an initial one in Hong Kong occurred in fully vaccinated people who developed no apparent sign of illness. A 62-year-old man who was infected in a quarantine hotel in Hong Kong did develop symptoms. Both places require negative Covid tests for travelers to enter, however, indicating these infections may have been at an early stage.The WHO said there was preliminary data showing a higher number of hospitalizations, \u201cbut this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected, rather than a result of specific infection with omicron.\u201dThe large number of mutations found in the omicron variant appears to destabilize the virus, which might make it less \u201cfit\u201d than the dominant delta strain, said Schoub.\u201cIn a way, hopefully it won\u2019t displace delta because delta we know responds very well to the vaccine,\u201d he said."}
{"text": "Last week, a hamlet in Uttarakhand\u2019s Pithoragarh district started sinking. The villagers had to be relocated to a new location. And, it was because of road construction without any slope management.\n\nDhar, a village in the Darma valley of Dharchula, is not the only village in the hilly terrain of Uttarakhand which has slipped from its original location due to road construction caused ecological imbalance in the fragile northwestern Himalayan region. Although the state government has not conducted any survey of such sinking villages, locals say the impact of road construction can be seen in villages on steep slopes.\nDhar (meaning steep slope) village is an important construct for the debate on whether the R 12,000 crore Char Dham road construction project should be treated as one for national security or for promoting tourism, pilgrimage and bringing economic prosperity to locals.\nSince the Char Dham project was envisaged in 2016, it was projected as the one to promote religious tourism in Uttarakhand. While inaugurating the project on December 27, 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the all-weather road would provide enormous employment to locals through an increase in religious tourism in the region. A Press Information Bureau statement then said the project was to provide \u201cbetter connectivity\u201d to Char Dham pilgrim places in the Himalayas, making journeys safer, faster and most convenient.\nIn September 2021, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh reiterated the same in a letter to former Lok Sabha member Revati Raman Singh saying the project is a flagship programme aimed at linking all important pilgrim sites in the state, which would also provide better connectivity for strategic locations.\nBut, in November 2021, the Ministry of Defence told the Supreme Court that the project was of national strategic importance because of the troop build-up by the Chinese on their side of the border and therefore, the ecological by-laws should not apply. \u201cChina is building helipads and buildings on the other side\u2026 so trucks carrying artillery, rocket launchers and tanks may have to pass through these roads,\u201d Attorney General KK Venugopal told the Court on November 9, while emphasising why environmental regulations should not apply to the project. In all this, he missed the original aim of connecting four pilgrim places in Uttarakhand \u2013 Gangotri, Yamnotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath.\nIntriguingly, the AG\u2019s claim is not applicable to Himachal Pradesh or Arunachal Pradesh, which shares a longer border with China than Uttarakhand, and where the main roads leading to the border are not even double-lane, and is some places are narrow single lane. Venugopal\u2019s submission in the court propels a key question \u2014 why does the Central government want the Supreme Court to consider the project as one of strategic importance now.\nThe answer apparently lies in the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) guidelines of 2014 for charging a toll on roads. According to the 2104 notification, the four-lane hill roads with paved shoulders can impose a toll tax of 60% of the specified fee. The Char Dham road being constructed under the Supreme Court supervision does not meet the criteria and therefore, may not attract toll tax. However, if the Supreme Court accepts the Defence Ministry plea of having a minimum seven-meter wide road excluding paved shoulders, the Char Dham project will be eligible for imposing toll tax.\nNHAI made its intention clear that it wants to impose a toll for using Char Dham road by issuing a notification for acquiring land to construct a toll collection centre in mid-2020 but its plans could not fructify because the Supreme Court reduced the width of the road to 5.5 meters without paved shoulders from the proposed 10 meters in September 2020. The petitioners in the case, Citizens for Green Doon, told the Supreme Court in November 2021 that increasing the width would result in the imposition of the toll on the highway, which had traditionally been a toll-free road. They also said that a road with a real road width of 6.5 meters with paved shoulders was enough to transport defence missile vehicles all along the highway.\nThe change in Centre\u2019s stand should be looked at with regard to the ecological cost of the project so far. NHAI in its submission this year informed the Supreme Court that it was treating about 100 slopes under the Char Dham project, where landslides have been witnessed due to road construction this monsoon. According to Ravi Chopra, who headed the Supreme Court-appointed high powered committee on Char Dham Project, 102 out of 172 fresh cut slopes on the national highway number 125 in Uttarakhand was landslide-prone, with 44 landslides reported there till mid-December 2019. \u201cSimilar situation prevails on all the Char Dham highways,\u201d he said.\nAccording to Uttarakhand Disaster Management Department, the number of landslides has increased to 972 in 2020 from only 33 in 2015 and experts said most of them were on the road construction sites triggered by extreme rainfall events. To be sure, the substantial increase in landslide number could be because of better recording.\nHindustan Times on September 13 reported weather-related calamities over the years have increased with the state registering 7,750 extreme rainfall events and cloud bursts since 2015, most of them over the last three years, that killed 230 people. In February this year, more than 200 people were killed after a glacier burst in Tapovan led to a sudden rise in the water level of the Dhauliganga river in Chamoli district that damaged two hydel projects. On May 3, several houses were damaged after heavy rainfall triggered landslides and floods in Uttarkashi and Rudraprayag districts. Days later, a cloudburst in Devprayag town in Tehri Garhwal washed away two local municipality buildings. On July 19, three persons, including a three-year-old girl, died following extreme rainfall in Uttarkashi district. In October, 46 people died due to extreme rainfall in Nainital and Chamoli districts, with part of a hill sliding into the famous Nainital Lake, resulting in it overflowing for the first time in over 50 years.\nExplaining the reasons behind the rise in such incidents, geologist CC Pant, a retired professor from Kumaon University, said hill cutting across Uttarakhand for constructions, development projects or activities such as the Char Dham road-building causes slope instability, making them more vulnerable to landslides. \u201cRoad construction on slopes with a weak foundation in times of extreme rainfall is a modern ecological catastrophe,\u201d Chopra said. Pradeep Kumar, Pithoragarh district geologist, who surveyed Dhar village, said the village started sinking because of the road widening work as it distributed the underground water channels and rock formations. And that is happening at several places on Char Dham project roads but the NHAI, which is implementing the project, has overlooked most as treating these sites fully could lead to substantial cost overrun.\nAs the Supreme Court itself pointed out that it needs to \u201cnuance\u201d ecological balance with strategic needs and may announce a new approach soon. The court should look at another important aspect \u2014 the people who live in the hills, as nobody seems to speak about them. They need developmental and economic opportunities like citizens in the rest of the country while protecting the environment, which is their livelihood source. Most people in the hills derive their income from horticulture, which is emerging as a major revenue source for locals and Uttarkhandis have the potential to match Himachal in horticulture produce. For that, they need both the Char Dham project that provides better connectivity to the market, that is the plains of India, and a sound environment that ensures high quality produce. Poor road connectivity has been the biggest bane for people in Himalayan hills and a reason for the high migration of Uttarkhandis from hills to plains. The Char Dham highway can undo that historical injustice by improving village connectivity through smaller roads. And last but not the least, the project will provide enormous economic activity as tourists would easily reach new places, making locals important stakeholders in tourism through home-stays and other auxiliary services.\nIn view of all this, the Supreme Court needs to issue comprehensive guidelines on ecological safeguards in view of the increasing extreme rainfall and to deal with a higher influx of people to the upper reaches of Uttarakhand. The guideline should clearly define the width of the hill roads as NHAI has come out with confusing norms and they should be applicable for all road construction projects across the Himalayas. The court should allow the NHAI to charge a toll on Char Dham, as it is a tourism project, with the condition that the revenue collected should be used only for ecological restoration including restoring traditional riverine systems. There should be an incentive for use of emission-free electric vehicles and a specialized agency to collect and treat waste.

Party workers met me all day on Tuesday expressing their anger at the local leadership ignoring merit and opting to go for their own loyalists. I could only tell them that I was not consulted on the matter.\u201dLast evening, Jarnail Singh had rushed to Sharma\u2019s house to bring him on board but Sharma stuck to his guns.The party is struggling with factionalism as four different groups have emerged under Garg, Chhabra, Sharma and former MP Harmohan Dhawan.The anger has been brewing in the party for some time now but has come out in the open only after the announcement of party tickets. The long-time party workers have been not happy with the recent joinees from the Congress getting a bigger role in the party affairs.A large number of Congress leaders joined the party after former Congress city president Chhabra joined the party in August this year. In the candidature list also on a number of seats recent Congress joinees have been preferred over older AAP members.Sahil Chawar, founder member of the party in the city and youth state general secretary, said, \u201cIt is disappointing that loyal party workers have been ignored and tickets have been given to the recent joinees from the BJP and the Congress. For the last more than 10 years, I have dedicatedly worked for the party but this is what we have received in return.\u201dAnother founder member of the party in the city and party\u2019s vice-president Yogesh Arora Soni said, \u201cBy ignoring merit in candidate selection, the party is inflicting self-damage. It can cost it the election also. But being a loyal party worker, I will stick to the party.\u201dStating that candidates are being para-dropped, party\u2019s vice-president Sanjeev Kochhar said, \u201cI have decided to contest the MC elections from Ward number 32 as an Independent candidate and will be filing my nomination papers in a couple of days.\u201dChawar said after consulting his supporters he would file nomination as an Independent candidate from Ward number 4.Responding to criticism, Garg, said, \u201cDelhi appointed observers covering all the wards. On recommendations party had to choose one candidate out of two. So, some dedicated workers also had to be left out. We respect workers right to protest.\u201dContest elections, Kejriwal tells senior leadersIn a bid to curb factionalism in the party, AAP supremo and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday night asked leaders of all four factions in the party to contest the election themselves. Garg, who received a call from Kejriwal, said, \u201cHe has asked all senior leaders of the party to contest the elections. We will hold a meeting in this regard on Wednesday and decide on the matter.\u201dThis is expected to bring supporters of all factions to work together and quell centripetal forces in the party.Previously, Garg, Chhabra, Sharma and Dhawan\u2019s son Bikram Dhawan (party\u2019s senior vice-president) had all decided against standing in the elections.Munieshwer A Sagar is a principal correspondent at Chandigarh and reports on real estate. \n...view detail"}
{"text": "The Gautam Budh Nagar police said on Wednesday it will launch an investigation into the assets of its SWAT team members, a day after the team was disbanded over allegations of taking a bribe from five suspects of a series of ATM thefts and allowing them to go scot-free three months ago.The alleged bribery came to the fore on Monday after the Ghaziabad police arrested the five men from Indirapuram. The suspects allegedly told the police that they had given \u20b920 lakh and a car to the SWAT team to secure their release.Following an internal inquiry, SWAT team inspector Shahvez Khan and head constable Amrish Yadav were dismissed from service on Tuesday, while nine others of the team were recalled to the police lines, the Noida police said. The 11-member team was involved in conducting special operations and solving serious crimes until its disbandment.Joint police commissioner Love Kumar said on the directions of police commissioner Alok Singh, the assets of the SWAT team members will be investigated. \u201cWe will form another SWAT team with new members,\u201d he said.DCP (crime) Abhishek, who conducted the preliminary inquiry into the bribery allegations, said, \u201cPrima facie, my probe has found the involvement of two policemen \u2014 Shahvez Khan and Amrish Yadav. I submitted the inquiry report to my seniors. As it is a confidential report, I cannot disclose more details,\u201d he said, refusing to reveal who else was involved in this racket.Late Tuesday night, police chief Alok Singh said, \u201cSWAT team inspector Shahvez Khan and head constable Amrish Yadav have been dismissed from service for their involvement in the case. Based on the DCP crime\u2019s report, I am convinced that they were involved in the case.\u201dNo police complaint has been filed in this regard as yet, said police on Wednesday. Shahvez Khan\u2019s mobile number remained switched off and he could not be reached for comment.The Ghaziabad police and its cyber cell on Monday arrested five members of a gang of ATM hackers in Ghaziabad\u2019s Indirapuram. They were identified as Shanavaz Chaudhary, Mohammad Sageer, Mohammad Mehraj, Mohammad Umar and Zameer Seikh -- all in the age group of 25-30 years.The Ghaziabad police said Shanavaz and one of his accomplices, Kamal, have BCA degrees and the gang used to deploy softwares through pen drives to hack ATMs and withdraw cash.Gyanendra Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (city 2), said five members of the gang were arrested and four others were on the run. He said the gang admitted to their involvement in hundreds of cases of ATM thefts, amounting to crores of rupees, in the past several years. During questioning, they told Ghaziabad police that they were nabbed by the Noida police three months ago and allowed to go in exchange for a bribe, an information they shared with their Noida counterparts, leading to the dismissals."}

Indore secured the first position across the country in the overall category.Officials said given the world class infrastructure Noida has, the authority believes that the city can easily secure the first position in the 2022 Swachh survey, the process of which is likely to begin from January next year.Officials discussed all details at a workshop in Balak Inter College in Sector 91 and issued instructions to concerned departments.\u201cThere should not be any encroachment on public land, especially within 100 metres of public toilets; toilets should be clean, civic infrastructure should be repaired and complaints on waste should be dealt with promptly,\u201d said Rajiv Tyagi, chief general manager of the Noida authority.On April 17,1976, the UP government established Noida--a well-planned industrial town--adjoining Delhi. Currently, it has around 12,000 industrial units and 165 residential sectors. Around 13% of the area in the city has been allocated for industrial purposes, 43% for residential purposes and the remaining land for other usages. Officials feel despite being a well planned city, it has failed to secure the top spot in the Swachh survey of the country.The chief general manager directed the staff to make sure all vending zones should be in order without chaos, only treated waste should be used for irrigation purposes and pubic spaces should be cleaned regularly.\u201cWe have appealed to all staff members to work in tandem with citizens to make the city clean and help it achieve the top sot in the survey. If the officials work together with citizens, Noida can easily secure the top spot,\u201d said Tyagi."}

Abhijit thus lifted his third title, which also accounted for his first win in six years. He took home prize of Rs. 6.46 lakh to move up nine spots to 15th place in the PGTI Order of Merit.Rookie Kartik Sharma (66-60-67-71) of Gurugram, who was placed second, one shot off the lead, after round three, returned a one-over 71 on the final day to finish second at 15-under 264. Kartik\u2019s round featured a birdie and two bogeys as the putts didn\u2019t roll in for him. Nonetheless, it was a career-best finish for the left-hander who moved up seven spots to 18th place in PGTI\u2019s merit list.

Play commenced on time on Saturday. The day witnessed a light drizzle in the afternoon towards the closing stages of the tournament.Abhijit Singh Chadha, a silver medalist from the 2010 Asian Games, dominated the proceedings from the outset in round four as he began pulling away from the rest of the field early on. After nearest challenger Kartik missed the green and the subsequent chip-putts to drop bogeys on the second and third, Abhijit further capitalized with 10-feet birdie conversions on the fifth and sixth to stretch his lead to a massive five shots.Thereafter, Kartik could not convert his opportunities on the greens and Abhijit maintained his lead before further extending it with birdies on the 16th and 17th, making a mammoth 66-feet putt on the latter. Chadha finally emerged triumphant by six shots after Sharma picked up a birdie on the 18th hole."}

Lack of cleanliness, choked sewers, dirty drinking water, inadequate parking space and garbage dumps alongside roads are key issues being faced by the residents.For the residents of the ward, which includes Sector 41, Sector 41 (Buterla) and sector 41 (Badheri village), development works came only when elections were due in some time. Sector 41 and Buterla were earlier part of ward number 19, along with Sector 42.On entering the ward, one can easily spot garbage piles along the roadsides in parks and at marketplaces.\u201cThe area has poor sanitation and cleanliness. Sweepers often miss their duties and do not clean roads. As a result, garbage piles get accumulated at public places inviting stray animals and health issues for residents. Also, the door-to-door garbage collection is irregular in the area. Not only this, people have to pitch in their own money to maintain the public parks as the MC is making little effort in making the ward beautiful,\u201d said Abhey Chandel, a resident of Sector 41.Residents said the parks do not have adequate lighting facilities due to which people avoid going there in the evenings.\u201cCouncillors usually prefer to carry out developmental works in their own locality and they ignore the other Sectors of the wards. The green belts in Sector 41 are not being maintained well by the MC. The parks do not have facilities like public toilets or drinking water. Besides, the Sector also lacks sanitation and we usually see garbage dumps lying on public places. The markets also need more parking space,\u201d said Dharampal, president, Resident Welfare Association (RWA) Sector 41 D.\u201cThe lanes and streets in Buterla are poorly built due to which dirty water enters in people\u2019s houses in the low-lying areas. Also, the area does not have facilities like parks for children. Sweepers dump garbage on the roadsides due to which stray dogs often roam in the lanes, causing inconvenience to people. The Chandigarh MC must ensure basic facilities to the people,\u201d said Priya Sharma, a resident of Buterla.Meanwhile, people living in Badheri village of Sector 41 do not even have access to the basic amenities. People are forced to drink dirty water and live in congested dirty lanes. \u201cHygiene is a big issue in the area. Garbage is not cleared from roads and parks regularly. Also, lanes are poorly built due to which water gets stagnant in the rainy season. Dangling electricity wires pose a threat to commuters. Residents of Badheri village are living in a mess,\u201d said Bharpur Singh, a local resident.KNOW YOUR WARDLocalities: Sector 41, Sector 41 (Buterla) and Sector 41 (Badheri village)Seat: GeneralVoters: Approximately 21,000Key Issues\u00b7 Poor sanitation and garbage dumps on roads\u00b7 Public facilities like parks, roads, toilets need regular maintenance\u00b7 Inadequate parking facility in marketsLOCAL VOICES:Sector 41 has some \u2018dark spots\u2019 where there are no streetlights.

{"text": "A day after saying that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress are both enemies of the party, Janata Dal (Secular) or JD (S) supremo HD Kumaraswamy on Tuesday said that the local leaders were given the freedom to back either of the national parties in the upcoming MLC polls, even though there was no formal alliance at the party level.Kumaraswamy\u2019s JD(S) is contesting just seven out of the 25 seats in the MLC polls on December 10.The former chief minister said that in the remaining 18 constituencies where the JD(S) has not fielded any candidates, the local leaders can choose to side with whoever they think would benefit the regional outfit in the long run.\u201cOur aim is 2023 (assembly elections), and to strengthen our party I have given instructions to our local leaders the freedom to make their own decisions,\u201d he said.The non-committal approach by the JD(S) helps the party steer clear of being associated with either of the two national parties, keeping the option to play the possible \u201ckingmaker\u201d open in case of another fractured verdict in 2023.The political tact of Kumaraswamy would also allow both the BJP and Congress to approach the local JD(S)leaders in several districts even though the party appears not to be in any formal alliance with either. The former chief minister and senior BJP leader BS Yediyurappa has maintained that he has sought support from the JD(S) for the MLC polls.\u201cWe have to see what decision JD(S) takes, but they are likely to give us support,\u201d Yediyurappa said on Tuesday, counting on the backing of the regional outfit to help keep the upper house of the state legislature under its control.The JD(S) is the only major political party in Karnataka that has allied with both the BJP and the Congress at the state level.JD(S) and the BJP consider Congress as the common enemy. The JD(S) has received the backing of BJP in the old Mysuru region in past elections while the reverse has been seen in the northern districts where the regional outfit has used its votes to help the saffron party. (This para needs attribution and facts when JDS got support and since when do they consider Congress the enemy)\u201cThis is not a question of Congress winning or the BJP. Wherever we (JD(S))are not contesting, our leaders have to cast their ballot and not casting it is wrong under democracy. So whichever side they vote for, it should not be detrimental to us,\u201d Kumaraswamy said.The Congress has chided the JD(S) for its decision calling it an understanding between the regional outfit and the BJP.\u201cWhat does that statement mean that he (Kumaraswamy) has told local leaders? Does it mean they will come with us? They have decided to go with the BJP. They are only saying it indirectly,\u201d Siddaramaiah, senior Congress leader and the former chief minister said in Mandya on Tuesday.State Congress president DK Shivakumar on Tuesday said that Yediyurappa seeking out support shows that the BJP is weak."}

{"text": "NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday told the Centre to decide soon on the mercy petition filed by former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi murder convict AG Perarivalan and posted his petition seeking premature release on ground of delay in deciding his clemency to January.Perarivalan filed his mercy plea before the Tamil Nadu governor in December 2015 under Article 161 of the Constitution which deals with remission powers of the Governor. After a delay of over five years, the governor decided in January this year to send the matter to the President. Since then, the matter was adjourned on two occasions and came up for hearing only on Tuesday.A bench headed by justice L Nageswara Rao said, \u201cThis matter has been pending for a long time. Decide it. We will post it in January next year.\u201dSenior advocate Gopal Shankarnaraynan appearing for Perarivalan said the petitioner has been in jail for three decades and urged the court to bring the governor\u2019s decision on record. \u201cThe governor is not a party to the proceedings filed by Perarivalan. However, on January 21, the governor intervened in the proceedings through solicitor general Tushar Mehta and informed that the mercy plea will be decided within a week,\u201d he said.The governor took a decision on January 25 which was conveyed to the court that the competent authority to decide on Perarivalan\u2019s remission was the President. Without specifying any time-frame, the Centre informed the top court that the proposal received from the governor will be processed in accordance with the law. No time frame was proposed for taking a decision.Perarivalan moved the Supreme Court in 2016 for an early decision on his pending remission plea. He was among the seven people convicted by a special TADA court for being part of the conspiracy to assassinate former PM Rajiv Gandhi on May 21, 1991. He is currently serving life sentence for having supplied the battery used in the bomb that resulted in the death of the former prime minister.Perarivalan said in his petition that the investigating officer in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case later made a disclosure that he made a mistake by excluding the exculpatory parts of the statement given by him during the recording of his evidence where he categorically denied having any knowledge of the assassination plot while supplying the battery."}

The chopper took off from the Sulur air base at 11.48am and lost contact with the air traffic control (ATC) at Sulur at 12.08pm, seven minutes before it was scheduled to land in Wellington.Rawat was on a visit to the prestigious Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) at Wellington to address the faculty and student officers there.The last rites of Rawat, Madhulika and Lidder will be performed at the Brar Square in Delhi Cantonment on Friday.The schedule for the last rites of the remaining nine people has not been finalised yet as the \u201cprocess for positive identification of their mortal remains is still on\u201d, a senior officer said.\u201cTheir mortal remains will be kept at the mortuary of Army Base Hospital till the completion of positive identification formalities,\u201d the officer said, adding appropriate military funerals of all deceased are being planned in consultation with their family members.The Coonoor crash is of one of the worst air accidents involving India\u2019s top military brass, and a setback to the ongoing military reforms in the country, the biggest since Independence. Rawat was spearheading the military\u2019s theaterisation drive to enhance the effectiveness of the armed forces and reshape the conduct of future operations. He took over as the CDS on December 31, 2019, after serving as the army chief for a full three-year term. He held the four-star rank for almost five years.Rawat survived a Cheetah crash in Dimapur in February 3, 2015. He was a lieutenant general at that time.PROBE BEGINSThe tri-service inquiry into the crash under Air Marshal Manavendra Singh has already begun its work, Rajnath told Parliament. Air Marshal Manavendra Singh is the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the IAF\u2019s Training Command in Bengaluru.\u201cWith profound grief and heavy heart, I stand to convey the unfortunate news of the crash of the military helicopter in the noon of December 8, 2021, with India\u2019s first Chief of Defence Staff, Gen Bipin Rawat onboard,\u201d Singh said.In his statement, the defence minister gave out the timeline of the developments before the crash. The helicopter took off from Sulur at 11:48am and was expected to land at Wellington by 12:15pm but the ATC at Sulur lost contact with the helicopter at 12:08pm, he said.After the crash, the minister said some locals spotted a fire in the forest near Coonoor and rushed to the spot where they sighted the helicopter\u2019s wreckage engulfed in flames. Rescue teams from the local administration reached the site and attempted to recover the survivors from the crash site, he said.\u201cAll those recovered from the wreckage were rushed to the Military Hospital, Wellington. Out of the total 14 persons onboard the ill-fated helicopter, 13 succumbed to their injuries,\u201d he said, reading out the names of all the people killed in the crash --- the CDS, Madhulika Rawat, Brig Lidder, Lt Col Harjinder Singh, Wing Commander Prithvi Singh Chauhan (pilot), Squadron Leader Kuldeep Singh (co-pilot), Junior Warrant Officers Rana Pratap Das and Arakkal Pradeep, Havildar Satpal Rai, Naik Gursewak Singh, Naik Jitendra Kumar, Lance Naik Vivek Kumar and Lance Naik B Sai Teja.The minister said Group Captain Varun Singh was on life support at the Military Hospital in Wellington and all efforts are being made to save him. The group captain was moved to the IAF Command Hospital in Bengaluru later in the day.The CDS will be cremated with full military honours, the minister said.\u201cI, on behalf of the august House, pay homage to the deceased persons and express condolences to the bereaved families,\u201d said an emotional Singh."}

{"text": "UP 2022 polls\u2019 eastern region battle is getting more interesting as three Brahmin leaders from the Bahujan Samaj Party and a BJP MLA in the region joined Samajwadi Party on Sunday.BJP MLA from Khalilabad seat in Sant Kabir Nagar, Digvijay Narain Chaubey, along with BSP leaders Vinay Shankar Tiwari (BSP MLA) Kushal Tiwari and Ganesh Shankar Pandey (former chairperson of UP Legislative Council) joined the resurgent Samajwadi Party in the presence of the SP chief Akhilesh Yadav at the SP state headquarters in Lucknow.The BSP expelled Vinay, Kushal, and Ganesh last week after it was clear in the political circles in UP that the three are headed to the SP.By executing the joining, the SP in one stroke rendered a blow to both the BJP and the BSP in eastern UP. The SP is expecting consolidation in Brahmin votes with these four inclusions.Vinay Shankar Tiwari, son of Hari Shankar Tiwari, is an MLA from Chillupar constituency, Kushal is a former MP from Sant Kabir Nagar, whereas Ganesh Shankar Pandey was the chairman of the Legislative Council at the time of the BSP government.There are talks in the political circles that Harishankar too would join the SP soon.Vinay and Kushal are the sons of influential eastern UP leaders from Gorakhpur, Harishankar Tiwari, while Ganesh is a nephew of Hari Shankar Tiwari.Hari Shankar Tiwari was the first public figure in Indian political history to be elected to the legislature from prison. Elected from Chillupar for the first time in 1985, he remained a member of the legislative assembly for 23 years uninterrupted. Tiwari is a known face of Brahmin politics in UP.He had been a cabinet minister in UP in BJP, BSP, and SP governments.Earlier in October, six suspended BSP MLAs joined Samajwadi Party in the presence of party chief Akhilesh Yadav in Lucknow. These MLAs include Hargovind Bhargav, Mujtaba Siddiqui, Hakim Lal Bind, Aslam Raini, Sushma Patel and Aslam Chaudhary.Uttar Pradesh is scheduled to go for Assembly polls in 2022.Previously, in the 2017 Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, the Bharatiya Janata Party bagged 312 seats out of the 403-seat Uttar Pradesh Assembly while Samajwadi Party (SP) bagged 47 seats, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) won 19 and the Congress could manage to win only seven seats. The rest of the seats were bagged by other candidates."}
{"text": "A day before over 1,000 doctors from across the state under the banner of the Haryana Civil Medical Services (HCMS) Association were scheduled to go on strike, state health minister Anil Vij on Sunday assured that all their issues will be resolved and the strike was postponed.The doctors held a meeting with the minister and director general of health services Veena Singh at the PWD rest house in Ambala Cantonment for more than an hour, where the chair was informed about all the demands.After the meeting, Vij said, \u201cI\u2019ve listened to the issues and will try to resolve all of them at the earliest. There is no need for a strike.\u201dDoctors of government hospitals in state had last week announced that they will go on a strike from December 13 \u2013 out-patient departments (OPDs) of all government hospitals will be closed for the whole day, and emergency and postmortem services will also be shut from December 14 \u2013 if the demands are not met.State HCMS president Dr Jasbir Singh Parmar said Vij was informed about the three demands on which he assured action at the earliest.\u201cWe have postponed the strike and I believe there will be no need for it if the demands are met by December 31. We are compelled to announce such strikes due to insensitive bureaucracy who are sitting on our files for a long time,\u201d Dr Parmar told the media after the meeting.The three demands include stopping direct recruitment of senior medical officers (SMOs), hiring of specialist doctors, and revision of the postgraduate policy.A member of the association said recently, additional chief secretary (ACS, health) Rajeev Arora had called a delegation of the aggrieved doctors for a meeting, who had later walked out \u201cbecause of his misbehaviour\u201d.\u201cVij was informed about this incident at the meeting. We believe due to direct recruitment, promotions of many officers in the department get affected. Moreover, nearly one-third of the specialists (700 against 2,000 posts) treat around 300 patients each daily against the required strength in acute mental pressure. Also, we are demanding a 40% quota for government doctors in medical colleges as per the Supreme Court guidelines,\u201d the member said, pleading anonymity."}

The police responded saying the local administration had advised the PDP to apply for holding this convention in a more open area in view of Covid-19 and security reasons.In a series of video messages on Twitter and then a press conference, Mehbooba said the administration remembers Covid-19 only when she decides to meet the youth of the Valley.\u201cFrom the past one week, all the leaders and parties have been organising meetings and rallies in every corner of the Valley and when the PDP decided to do the same in my own home why were we stopped,\u201d she said.\u201cThey are sabotaging (us). New ways are found to usurp the rights of youth here to take them away from democracy and push them towards violence,\u201d she said.Later at a press conference, Mehbooba said they were preparing for the youth convention as all political parties were organising rallies in the Valley these days.\u201cCongress, National Conference, Apni Party or People\u2019s Conference \u2013all are conducting meetings and we had also made a programme,\u201d she said.She said they had written to the deputy commissioner for some space for organising the youth convention some time back. \u201cBut we got no response to that. Even Covid was not that much at that time,\u201d she said.She said that when she decided to go for a youth convention the administration stopped her and sent her a communication citing Covid.\u201cThe youths were not only stopped but they were assaulted and roughed up. Their clothes were torn and their mobiles were snatched at places. A few were put in police stations,\u201d she alleged. \u201cEven today Omar Abdullah is holding a rally at Anantnag and two days ago, Apni Party had a joining programme,\u201d she said.A police spokesman said in the convention a gathering of at least 1,000 people was expected.\u201cGiven the prevalent Covid situation and larger security implications resulting from allowing such a large number of people and accompanying cars and vehicles into a high-security zone, it was not advisable to allow such a large flow of people and unchecked vehicles,\u201d the spokesman said.\u201cThere are credible inputs of vehicle-bound IEDs being used to target civilians and high-security installations. The Gupkar Road houses high-security buildings of various organisations and security-sensitive establishments and intelligence agencies. Allowing a large number of vehicles to be parked in this high security zone would have jeopardised the security in the area,\u201d the spokesman said.\u201cIt is incorrect that Mehbooba is under house arrest. However, the local administration had advised the PDP to apply for holding this convention in a more open area in view of Covid-19 and security reasons,\u201d the spokesman said.Meanwhile, Sajad Lone\u2019s People\u2019s Conference on Sunday accused the administration of denying them to organise a convention in Kupwara.\u201cIt is highly unfortunate that repeated requests by JKPC to hold a convention in Kupwara are denied due to Covid concerns while other parties are facilitated and allowed a free hand to hold public rallies, \u201c the party said in a tweet.Meanwhile, NC vice-president Omar Abdullah addressed a gathering at the Dak Bungalow in Anantnag."}

While this was two degrees below normal, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 22.4\u00b0C, a notch below normal. The cooler days and nights did, however, adversely affect pollution levels, pushing the air quality index (AQI) into the \u2018very poor\u2019 zone.Delhi recorded this season\u2019s lowest minimum temperature \u2014 6.4\u00b0C \u2014 a day earlier, and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the city can expect a similar chill for the rest of the week.RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD, said the minimum temperature will hover between 6\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C till the end of the week, with two western disturbances in the northern plains likely to marginally influence Delhi.\u201cThese are feeble western disturbances, so the impact will not be too significant. The minimum may rise to 8\u00b0C, but a drop in mercury is expected from December 17,\u201d said Jenamani.At 6.6\u00b0C, Safdarjung was the coldest spot in Delhi on Monday morning, while Mayur Vihar in east Delhi recorded the city\u2019s lowest maximum at 20.8\u00b0C. The IMD\u2019s forecast for Tuesday showed that the maximum is likely to hover around 23\u00b0C, and the minimum will remain around 6\u00b0C.The drop in temperatures, particularly at night and in the early hours of the day has also pushed Delhi\u2019s air quality back into the \u2018very poor\u2019 category, with a 24-hour average AQI of 331 at 4pm, according to the Central Pollution Control Board. In comparison, it was 254 (poor) on Sunday.Experts said wind speeds are again expected to pick up from December 15.\u201cThe AQI will hover between \u2018poor\u2019 and \u2018very poor\u2019 during this period. Low temperatures are unfavourable for the dispersal of pollutants, but an increase in wind speeds from December 15 may once again bring down the AQI to \u2018poor\u2019,\u201d said Gufran Beig, founder and project director, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar) \u2014 a forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences.The Early Warning System (EWS) for Delhi, which also falls under the ministry of earth sciences, also forecasts Delhi\u2019s air quality to hover between \u2018poor\u2019 and \u2018very poor\u2019 during the next seven days, with severe air unlikely at the moment.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said Delhi\u2019s air quality generally tends to return to the \u2018severe\u2019 category by the last week of December, as low temperatures combine with dense fog to trap pollutants. \u201cLow temperatures slow down the air and the moisture content from the fog also traps pollutants. We may once again see a spell of severe air towards end December and early January,\u201d said Roychowdhury."}

{"text": "PUNE The Pune police have allegedly uncovered manipulation of results and exam sheets of 550-600 teaching position aspirants who could not clear the Teacher eligibility test (TET) that was held on July 15, 2018 and advertised in 2017. According to Police officials, the manipulation was done in exchange of \u20b950,000-60,000 from each candidate and has garnered around \u20b95 crore, said officials.Therefore, a fourth case was registered in the ongoing uncovering of malpractices in the state government examination process and former Maharashtra state council of examination (MSCE) commissioner Sukhdev Dere, 61, a resident of Gunjalwadi in Sangamner area of Ahmednagar, along with former project manager of GA Software Ashwin Kumar, 41, a resident of Harbour Layout, Kalyan Nagar in Bengaluru were arrested. They were remanded to seven days in police custody by Judicial Magistrate First Class SG Dolare with Public prosecutor Vijaysinh Jadhav and Defence lawyer Pranay Lanjile appearing for both the accused.\u201cThe people from inside the department as well as GA software and agents were involved. The OMR sheets were manipulated. If they were not able to manipulate OMR sheets, they would ask the candidates who paid to keep the sheet blank and then filled it out later. So far, we believe 500 sheets were manipulated but investigation is on. Prima facie the financial involvement of \u20b95 crore is estimated,\u201d said Amitabh Gupta, commissioner of Pune police.\u201cThe Pune police acted on a fresh complaint and arrested two persons. There may be an involvement of more and police are investigating it,\u201d Gupta added.\u201cI (Dere) retired in August 31, 2018. The exam result was declared after my retirement. How can I possibly interfere once I had retired? There is no recovery done from me and I have not absconded. If I had done anything wrong, I could have run away when the first case was registered,\u201d said Advocate Lanjile while seeking magisterial custody, instead of police custody, for Dere in court. However, prosecutor claimed that Dere was retained as a consultant by GA Software which allowed him enough access to manipulate the result.A case under Sections 406, 409, 420, 465, 467, 468, and 34 of Indian Penal Code along with Section 66(d) of Information Technology Act, and Sections 7 and 8 has been registered.\u201cThere was a complaint regarding this in 2018 as well. And one candidate had also lodged a case but it did not reach a logical conclusion back then. But we are investigating every possible angle now,\u201d said Commissioner Gupta.While Supe is involved in the manipulation of TET 2019-20, Dere is involved in the manipulation of TET 2018. However, GA Software company is common in both the incidents even though the director of the company changed. Therefore, it is pertinent to note that it is not only TET but multiple other exams including Class 5 and Class 8 teacher grant exam, typing and shorthand exam, ECB scholarship exam, interdepartmental recruitment exam, DLED and multiple such exams by the education department are conducted by outsourced companies.\u201cFirst, TET is conducted. Those who qualify are granted a certificate which allows them to appear for Teacher Aptitude and Intelligence Test (TAIT). GA Software was in the process of getting the contract for TAIT exam as well. The manipulation was in the TET exam. In the 2018 exam, some unqualified candidates have already been issued the certificates. In the 2020 case, the certificates have not been issued yet,\u201d said Bhagyashree Navatake, deputy commissioner of police, cyber-crime and economic offence wing of Pune police.\u201cThe software companies are same and so are the officials. It is the agents who enable the process. So far, the Harkal brothers have turned out to be the agents who were at the forefront,\u201d said Commissioner Gupta.Subsequently, the candidates who made the list based on merit suffered. Moreover, there were candidates who paid the money and did not get into the manipulated list either. \u201cAt least 17-18 students have approached us so far,\u201d said DCP Navatake."}

This shall be a permanent exhibition and the passengers using Delhi Metro network\u2019s largest interchange facility shall be able to visit this exhibition without any additional cost,\u201d said Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC.Officials said the new signalling system -- Indigenous\u2013Automatic Train Supervision technology (i-ATS technology) -- is one of the many significant achievements of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and was jointly developed by the DMRC and Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL)Explaining the new technology, Dayal said, \u201cThe development of the i-ATS system is a major step towards the development of an indigenously built CBTC (Communication-based Train Control) based signalling technology for Metro railway... The i-ATS is a computer-based system, which manages train operations.\u201dHe said that the new system is indispensable for high density operations, such as the Metro, where services are scheduled every few minutes. \u201ci-ATS is an indigenously developed technology, which will now significantly reduce the dependence of Indian Metros on foreign vendors dealing with such technologies\u2026India will become one of the few countries in the world to have its own ATS product which can be implemented in other Metros as well as railway systems,\u201d Dayal said."}

The anthropologist/author was just out with a book called Muscular India, and as the former editor of Men\u2019s Health India, would I be keen to add my perspective?I didn\u2019t do the \u201cLive\u201d solely because I didn\u2019t find the time to read the book!A few months later, some friends texted me snapshots of the page where Baas had credited Men\u2019s Health for the increased interest in six-pack abs and a muscular physique among Indian men. But it was only months later, when a former colleague praised the way the author had drawn parallels between the aspirations and frustrations of the Indian middle class, that I got down to reading it.Muscular India is now amongst those books that will stay on my bookshelf for years to come. One: It understands the many levels of the middle class India that I grew up in and reflects correctly the constant need to belong. Two: It clarifies that muscular men are, in fact, not symbols of uncontrollable strength, but focused, disciplined, and waiting to be noticed. And three: It chronicles how the obsession for fitness has shown toxic masculinity the door.Baas\u2019s book tells us how the love for bodybuilding doesn\u2019t contribute to the problem of sexual violence; that it, in fact, takes the idea of masculinity away from it.It is disappointing that it took a non-Indian author to give us such a great reflection of how \u201cgetting in shape\u201d showcases the young Indian man\u2019s ambition and frames his sense of discipline, while also bringing the acceptance that nobody would have expected from a steroids-fuelled obsession.This is one book that I wish I had written myself.Jamal Shaikh is National Editor - Brunch and New Media Initiatives at the Hindustan Times.

{"text": "Another year has hurtled by, but the pandemic is still around. For car buyers, that means staying safe inside an air-conditioned car rather than an Ola or Uber.Yes, buying a car has shot up the priority list. But sadly, manufacturers haven\u2019t been able to cash in because critical parts are in short supply the world over. As a result, waiting lists are stretching into months and even a year. But, despite this turbulence, over 30 new models were launched this year. Which were the ones that impressed the most? Here\u2019s my top five in alphabetical order.1 Hyundai AlcazarHyundai\u2019s Alcazar is more than just an elongated Creta. Unique to this six-seven seater Hyundai is more equipment, a pair of plush captain seats and a new 2-litre engine mated to a smooth automatic transmission which makes it very city-friendly. It\u2019s tight on space compared to other seven-seaters, but its \u2018not too big, not too small\u2019 footprint makes it convenient to manoeuvre and park.2 Mahindra XUV700Mahindra has thrown everything it possibly can at the XUV700, and the result is an SUV that stands head and shoulders above the competition. The silky smooth and powerful pair of diesel engines and petrol engines are in a class of their own, which makes the XUV700 a pleasure to drive. The spacious cabin richly appointed with a high-tech infotainment system and a mind-boggling array of equipment pampers passengers. It is one of those rare products that has become an icon even before reaching customers\u2019 hands. As things stand, the earliest you can get your hands on one is 2023!3 Renault KigerThe Renault Kiger sits at the budget-end of the compact SUV segment, but with its spacious cabin, tough suspension and easy handling, it doesn\u2019t feel cut-price. Features like a full-digital instrument panel, multiple driving modes and ambient lighting for the cabin is the stuff you only find in more expensive cars.There are two engine options; the base 1.0 petrol is quite weak but the 1.0 turbo has enough oomph and is the one to pick. You can have this compact SUV for hatchback money and hence, for sheer value, the Kiger is hard to beat4. Skoda Kushaq / VW TaigunThe Skoda Kushaq and Volkswagen Taigun are clubbed together because both these models belong to the same parent (the VW Group) and, under the skin, share the same suspension, engines and other mechanical bits. The interiors are a touch small and not as luxurious as their rivals\u2019, but both these SUVs have best-in-class ride and handling and a strong pair of turbo-petrol engines that complement their sporty dynamics. Choosing one will boil down to looks\u2014Kushaq is sharp-edged; Taigun handsome.5 Tata SafariAs a product, the Tata Safari may be eclipsed by the XUV700, but there\u2019s an honesty about the Safari that is endearing. The Land Rover pedigree is evident in the way it pummels bad roads and the third row is surprisingly spacious. The engine, though strong, feels a bit gruff and the infotainment system and analogue instrumentation looks outdated.The views expressed by the columnist are personalFrom HT Brunch, December 26, 2021Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunchConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunchHormazd Sorabjee is one of the most senior and much loved auto journalists in India, and is the editor of Autocar India. \n...view detail"}

{"text": "Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his opposition to racial discrimination in South Africa, has died. He was 90.Tutu died on Sunday in Cape Town, President Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s office said in a statement. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 and underwent surgery. Tutu was subsequently hospitalized several times to undergo treatment for infections and other ailments.As South Africa\u2019s first Black Anglican archbishop, Tutu used his international profile to lobby for sanctions against the White-minority government. From 1996 to 1998, he led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, aimed at exposing the injustices of the past.\u201cDesmond Tutu was a patriot without equal; a leader of principle and pragmatism who gave meaning to the biblical insight that faith without works is dead,\u201d Ramaphosa said.Tutu\u2019s brand of activism was shaped by his religious conviction, a mischievous sense of humor, and physical bravery that once led him to rush into a mob to save the life of a young woman about to be lynched on suspicion of being a police informer.\u2018Moral Universe\u2019\u201cThis is a moral universe; God is in charge of this world,\u201d was a favorite saying of the man who, as archbishop of Cape Town, liked to wear a T-shirt emblazoned: \u201cJust Call Me Arch.\u201dBorn on Oct. 7, 1931, in Klerksdorp, west of Johannesburg, Tutu worked as a teacher before entering a theological seminary. He was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1961, obtained a master\u2019s degree in theology at King\u2019s College, University of London, and in 1975 was appointed Dean of Johannesburg, the first Black person to hold the post.With many of South Africa\u2019s Black leaders in jail, including Nelson Mandela, and others in exile, Tutu emerged as a leading voice of Black defiance against apartheid.He became general secretary of the South African Council of Churches, an organization at the forefront of the struggle against White-minority rule, in 1978. He called for economic sanctions against the apartheid regime, in defiance of a law that made it illegal to advocate such actions. The government responded by withdrawing his passport.Nobel PrizeIn 1984, the Nobel Committee awarded Tutu its annual Peace Prize, citing his \u201crole as a unifying leader figure in the campaign to resolve the problem of apartheid in South Africa.\u201dTutu was appointed Archbishop of Cape Town, the titular head of the Anglican Church in southern Africa, in 1986 and held the post until 1995 when he was named to lead the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.Tutu openly wept while listening to victims of South Africa\u2019s pre-1994 system of institutionalized racial discrimination, yet opposed Nuremberg-style trials for those responsible for the atrocities.Even after apartheid\u2019s demise in 1994, Tutu never lost his outrage at injustice or his capacity for protest. Soon after South Africa\u2019s first democratic vote, won by Mandela\u2019s African National Congress, he criticized the new government for \u201cstopping the gravy train just long enough to get on.\u201dMbeki CriticHe also accused former President Thabo Mbeki of not doing enough to combat poverty and the spread of AIDS, and for remaining silent about human-rights abuses in neighboring Zimbabwe.Tutu also clashed with Jacob Zuma, Mbeki\u2019s successor as head of the ANC, saying he should have faced trial on charges of taking bribes from arms dealers. The case against Zuma was dropped in April 2009, just weeks before he was elected president, but was subsequently reinstated and is currently before the courts.Tutu officially retired from public life in 2010, yet continued to do charity work through his Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation.When the Zuma administration denied an entry visa to the Dalai Lama in 2014, Tutu accused it of \u201ckowtowing\u201d to China and said he was \u201cashamed to call this lickspittle bunch my government.\u201dIn 2017, he joined tens of thousands of people who took to the streets to demand Zuma\u2019s ouster, after the president\u2019s firing of his respected finance minister caused the rand to crash. The ANC forced Zuma to quit the following year.Tutu made a public appearance in Cape Town in May 2021 to get his coronavirus vaccine and encouraged others to follow suit.Tutu is survived by his wife, Leah, and four children."}

The key speakers said that \u201cplastic waste can be treated and handled scientifically only after all stakeholders come forward for the purpose\u201d.\u201cWe will have to restore the autonomy to our villages where plastic was not in use traditionally earlier. But now, we have realised that plastic is slowly making its way into villages, which is not a good sign. We need to work together so that the old village life, where plastic was not in use, can be encouraged. We need to use alternatives of plastic material such as clay made glass,\u201d said Justice Agarwal, adding that such seminars should be organised in rural areas where awareness needs to be generated among masses.\u201cA plastic product takes 1 million years to merge with the soil. Therefore, the time is to spread awareness in all sections of the society, particularly in rural areas,\u201d Agarwal added.Key speakers deliberated on the need that state and central government bodies, and the private sector should work together to discourage the use of plastic. \u201cThe governments, both at the state level and the central level, are coming up with policies, which will help in handling of plastic waste properly. But the need is that everyone takes part in this campaign,\u201d said Mathuria."}

The outfit decided to hold a \u201clarge rally\u201d in the town on January 10 against the state government over its demands.Buta Singh Burjgill, state president of the BKU faction, said, \u201cThough we will not participate in elections, we have decided not to oppose the Sanyukt Samaj Morcha.

{"text": "US health officials on Monday cut isolation restrictions for Americans who catch the coronavirus from 10 to five days, and similarly shortened the time that close contacts need to quarantine.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said the guidance is in keeping with growing evidence that people with the coronavirus are most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop.The decision also was driven by a recent surge in Covid-19 cases, propelled by the omicron variant.Early research suggests omicron may cause milder illnesses than earlier versions of the coronavirus. But the sheer number of people becoming infected \u2014 and therefore having to isolate or quarantine \u2014 threatens to crush the ability of hospitals, airlines and other businesses to stay open, experts say.CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the country is about to see a lot of omicron cases.\"Not all of those cases are going to be severe. In fact many are going to be asymptomatic,\u201d she told The Associated Press on Monday. \u201cWe want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning while following the science.\"Last week, the agency loosened rules that previously called on health care workers to stay out of work for 10 days if they test positive. The new recommendations said workers could go back to work after seven days if they test negative and don\u2019t have symptoms. And the agency said isolation time could be cut to five days, or even fewer, if there are severe staffing shortages.Now, the CDC is changing the isolation and quarantine guidance for the general public to be even less stringent.The change is aimed at people who are not experiencing symptoms. People with symptoms during isolation, or who develop symptoms during quarantine, are encouraged to stay home.The CDC\u2019s isolation and quarantine guidance has confused the public, and the new recommendations are \u201chappening at a time when more people are testing positive for the first time and looking for guidance,\u201d said Lindsay Wiley, an American University public health law expert.Nevertheless, the guidance continues to be complex.IsolationThe isolation rules are for people who are infected. They are the same for people who are unvaccinated, partly vaccinated, fully vaccinated or boosted.They say:\u2014The clock starts the day you test positive.\u2014An infected person should go into isolation for five days, instead of the previously recommended 10.\u2014At the end of five days, if you have no symptoms, you can return to normal activities but must wear a mask everywhere \u2014 even at home around others \u2014 for at least five more days.\u2014If you still have symptoms after isolating for five days, stay home until you feel better and then start your five days of wearing a mask at all times.QuarantineThe quarantine rules are for people who were in close contact with an infected person but not infected themselves.For quarantine, the clock starts the day someone is alerted they may have been exposed to the virus.Previously, the CDC said people who were not fully vaccinated and who came in close contact with an infected person should stay home for at least 10 days.Now the agency is saying only people who got booster shots can skip quarantine if they wear masks in all settings for at least 10 days.That\u2019s a change. Previously, people who were fully vaccinated \u2014 which the CDC has defined as having two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine \u2014 could be exempt from quarantine.Now, people who got their initial shots but not boosters are in the same situation as those who are partly vaccinated or are not vaccinated at all: They can stop quarantine after five days if they wear masks in all settings for five days afterward.Five daysSuspending both isolation and quarantine after five days is not without risk.A lot of people get tested when they first feel symptoms, but many Americans get tested for others reasons, like to see if they can visit family or for work. That means a positive test result may not reveal exactly when a person was infected or give a clear picture of when they are most contagious, experts say.When people get infected, the risk of spread drops substantially after five days, but it does not disappear for everyone, said Dr. Aaron Glatt, a New York physician who is a spokesman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\u201cIf you decrease it to five days, you're still going to have a small but significant number of people who are contagious,\u201d he said.That's why wearing masks is a critical part of the CDC guidance, Walensky said.Varying recommendationsThe new CDC guidance is not a mandate; it\u2019s a recommendation to employers and state and local officials. Last week, New York state said it would expand on the CDC\u2019s guidance for health care workers to include employees who have other critical jobs that are facing a severe staffing shortage.It\u2019s possible other states will seek to shorten their isolation and quarantine policies, and CDC is trying to get out ahead of the shift. \u201cIt would be helpful to have uniform CDC guidance\u201d that others could draw from, rather than a mishmash of policies, Walensky said.Given the timing with surging case counts, the update \u201cis going to be perceived as coming in response to pressure from business interests,\u201d Wiley said. But some experts have been calling for the change for months, because shorter isolation and quarantine periods appeared to be sufficient to slow the spread, she said.The move by CDC follows a decision last week by U.K. officials to reduce the self-isolation period for vaccinated people who test positive for Covid-19."}
{"text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched a system to award blockchain-based educational degrees in digital form to students. These digital degrees can be verified globally and are unforgeable, according to IIT Kanpur director.The technology has been developed by the institute under the National Blockchain Project.Later, addressing the convocation, PM Modi said that technology is the future and it is getting priceless gifts from prestigious institutes like IIT Kanpur.Here is everything you need to know about the blockchain-based digital degree and how it will impact the educational sector in the futureDecentralised technologyThe blockchain system works on the principle of decentralisation. This means that the control is not in the hands of a central agency, but to a distributed network of nodes.This will help in keeping the data safe even if any specific node is compromised.Also, the information in a blockchain is recorded and stored sequentially along with an exact timestamp. The previous information can\u2019t be altered, only amended by adding a new block. This makes tampering with a transcript very hard.Maintaining student recordsThe blockchain technology can simplify the tedious task of maintain the records of students by making them digitised. Also, the students will be able to access their records remotely.According to US-based Maryville University, the blockchain technology can simplify the verification process. Any institute can do so with a few clicks instead of going through lots of paper documentation, in cases of transfer students, or sharing records with employers, or issuing degrees.Help in preparing curriculum and gradingThe blockchain technology, through its algorithms, also allows teachers to execute a particular curriculum when certain conditions are met. The teachers can set lessons and courses into a blockchain, including programming the tasks too. The algorithm can then verify the completion of each task and provide students with the next one until all the tasks are complete.The same technology can also assist the teachers in grading. The blockchain technology can grade students based on their responses in exams \u2013 the algorithm takes into consideration questions, answers, and scoring parametres.Lowering costsThe blockchain technology can lower costs by opening affordable paths to learning. It will require less manual intervention, thereby reducing the need to hire more staff for processes.The technology is already being used in the financial sector and has been powering currencies like bitcoin.ChallengesIronically, security is one of the primary challenges of using the blockchain technology for any purpose. Increased security doesn\u2019t mean that blockchain is not vulnerable. It also eliminates the possibility of modifying student records for legitimate purposes.There is also a limitation with scaling the system beyond a certain level. Increasing the network means adding more blocks, which will slow down the speed of transaction as each transaction requires peer-to-peer verification."}

Though quietness is not absolute \u2014 there are sounds, too \u2014 a sense of silence does linger around, imperceptibly, as if it were hiding behind a tree.Strolling aimlessly along this partially busy road is like detoxing yourself from your daily existence. The many layers that complicate one\u2019s life are peeled away, leaving one raw and fresh. It is a wonder that no guidebook has recommended a walk down this short route. Tucked in the heart of south Delhi, it is merely exploited as a road to link Aurobindo Marg to the touristy Hauz Khas Village. But this brief stretch ought to be revered as a destination.The starting point is marked with the Green Park Free Church, whose prayer hall is intensely meditative. On the left is the Aurobindo Market, with its assortment of charming long-time shops, whose owners have a chatty bond with their customers, evocative of small-town bazaars. More points of interest wait ahead, such as the monumental Dadi Poti ke Makbare \u2014 two centuries-old domes, with a sloping ground of grass on which the area\u2019s pre-Omicron office goers would lie down during their lunch break. Another monument, Barah Khamba, lies on the other side of the lane, littered with graves of unknown people. Further ahead, another prominent monument. Chhoti Gumti is truly chhoti. The area\u2019s dog walkers often let their pets run over its lawn, while idle pigeons sit on the dome.The most cherishable characteristic about these landmarks is that they are not loud about their attraction. Contentedly ensconced in their solitary world of trees and stones, they seem to assure the guilty passerby that \u201cit is okay if you feel too lazy to survey our antiquity right now. Come tomorrow, or the day after, we are not going away\u201d. (In any case, most of them are temporarily closed to visitors due to the pandemic.)As you walk ahead, a shining white vision appears in the form of Jagannath Mandir. The entrance is adorned with a sacred wheel, which, according to a hoarding, was used in 2018 on the chariot of Lord Jagannath in Puri, Odisha. Across the road from the temple, Shambhu Nath\u2019s evening-hour snack stall serves Odisha-style vada, accompanied with the traditional ghugni. Unfortunately, he is not coming these days due to coronavirus-related concerns, but is expected to reopen his stall on Monday.Further along, the views on both sides of the road become wilder, full of trees and bushes. And then suddenly, you are in Hauz Khas Village with its crowd and noise."}

Its initial 24 trustees included Dr Rajendra Prasad, Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.After the National Gandhi Smarak Nidhi came into being, its units were set up in different states, including in Bihar in 1952. These units were to sustain themselves on donations.\u201cInitially, we used to undertake several kinds of activities, like publication of books, screening films and holding school level activities on Gandhi.

It\u2019s expected to generate funds at the local level to sustain itself, but donations dried up in the 1980s,\u201d he said.The Gandhi Smarak Nidhi building in Patna once used to be the centre of students\u2019 activities during the JP movement in the 1970s, which threw up leaders like chief minister Nitish Kumar, former CM Lalu Prasad, former union minister late Ramvilas Paswan, to name a few.\u201cBut no one makes any donations to the Gandhi Smarak Nidhi. We had to stop publication works due to fund crisis. We even stopped film screening,\u201d Ranjan said.Earlier, a team of Smarak Nidhi used to visit villages for screening of films on Gandhi. It had a good collection of films and a projector machine.\u201cBut in 1980, the projector machine a developed technical snag. It couldn\u2019t be repaired as we didn\u2019t have fund.

{"text": "Most high-profile government documents \u2014 budgets, economic surveys, erstwhile five-year plans \u2014 typically relegate environment, sustainability and climate change to a residual last section \u2014 an afterthought.\u00a0\n\nThis is why it is pleasantly surprising to see that the Union Budget of 2022-23 projects low-carbon development as an economic opportunity, discusses clean energy as a sunrise sector and calls for reimagining cities as centres of \u201csustainable living\u201d. The shift in language is worth noticing. It hints at an important change: The environment as a drag on the economy to one that can be made to work with and even enhance the quality of growth. However, while there are some meaningful nuggets in the Budget, the overall contents fall short of the packaging.\nFirst, the positive nuggets. The government has announced \u201cproduction-linked incentives\u201d for domestic manufacture of solar photovoltaic cells. While solar energy promotion has always been on the agenda of this government, the attention to creating a manufacturing base, and, therefore, jobs, is important, and welcome.\nThe Budget also signals a strong bet on electric vehicles (EVs) as a sunrise sector, announcing a more than three-fold increase in subsidy and a battery swapping and interoperability policy. The latter is important as it enables much lower costs in EVs because batteries can be treated as a service and paid for over time rather than as a lumpy capital cost. Significantly, the EV push occurs in the context of a commitment to support public transport in urban areas \u2014 although there is no enhanced support for this \u2014 and a vision of urban transformation, as yet to be laid out.\nFinally, there is recognition of the need to mobilise finance for green investments and some concrete measures for doing so. Among these, \u2018green bonds\u2019 have received the most attention, although it is important to see the details before deciding their full implications.\nHowever, there are at least three areas where the details fall well short of the overall marketing. First, to truly examine whether this is a green budget, it is important to look not only at the components flagged as green, but at the centre of gravity of the spending allocations. Most notably, the Gati Shakti package stimulus through infrastructure spending shows little sign of mainstreaming the environment, focusing on transitional infrastructure such as roads, railways, and airports. Mainstreaming sustainability would have required including thinking on how this capital expenditure could shift India to a low-carbon and climate-resilient society, while also providing much-needed stimulus. For example, investing in rural productivity together with decentralised power systems would allow for both social and environmental objectives to be met. Using the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) expenditures to support ecological restoration could have enhanced climate resilience. Turning to roads and airports suggests a lack of imagination and a missed opportunity.\nSecond, while energy transformation looms large in the packaging, bringing about such transformations require comprehensive shifts beyond renewable energy promotion. Notably, the Budget is silent on the need to prepare coal-dependent areas for a \u2018just transition\u2019 based on alternative jobs and livelihoods within a regional development framework. Moreover, there is no follow-up on the finance minister\u2019s nudge in past Budgets for retirement and environmental compliance of old and polluting coal power plants. Another area necessary for an energy transformation \u2014 reform of discoms \u2014 receives limited attention, with anticipated additional expenditures essentially pushed onto states. Renewable energy promotion is necessary, but not a sufficient condition for energy transformation; the complementary parts are missing.\nThird, in some areas, the Budget betrays a costly old school \u2018growth versus environment\u2019 mindset, that fails to recognise the importance of the environment in a sustainable future. Enhanced measures to address air pollution \u2014 a public health crisis in India \u2014 are conspicuous by their absence, and, in fact, there is a seeming rollback on subsidies for Liquified Petroleum Gas for cooking, one of the true success stories in recent years.\nThe aggressive promotion of river interlinking projects \u2014 with support announced for the Ken-Betwa link and five more in the pipeline \u2013 ignores substantial evidence of ecological harm from river interlinking. And, the language on accelerating green clearances does not help allay fears that ecological quality will receive short shrift when balanced against project clearances.\nUltimately, however, looking for green transformation in a Budget risks looking in the wrong place. Budgets can at best help realise such visions and indicate the balance across competing priorities. But envisioning and defining transformation should happen further upstream, through the creation of institutions that can provide clear strategic thinking, long-term analytical capacity, and clear visioning to chart low-carbon, job-creating, climate-resilient and equitable transitions. In the absence of such strategic thinking, we end up with scattershot approaches that result in a few positive hits but also more than a few misses, as is the case in the current Budget.\nNavroz K Dubash is a professor at the Centre for Policy Research\u00a0\nThe views expressed are personal\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy unlimited digital access with HT Premium\nSubscribe Now to continue reading\nStart 15 Days Free Trial\n\nAlready Subscribed? \nSign In\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE ONThis is why it is pleasantly surprising to see that the Union Budget of 2022-23 projects low-carbon development as an economic opportunity, discusses clean energy as a sunrise sector and calls for reimagining cities as centres of \u201csustainable living\u201d.

{"text": "With the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) allowing schools to resume in-person classes from Monday, for students of grades nine to 12, school administrators said on Friday that they will focus on bridging learning gaps and easing students into the offline stream. For the first time since the pandemic began in 2020, schools have been allowed to function without a 50% cap on classroom capacity.School heads said the learning gap had widened considerably due to frequent closures and were hopeful that there will not be any further disruptions going forward. They said the resumption of in-person classes will allow them to prepare students for the end-of-term exams and the board exams in a more efficient manner.The reopening in Delhi comes at a time when the Centre has been emphasising on mitigating learning loss caused by Covid-19. In the modified school reopening guidelines, the Union government has focused on the smooth transition from online to classroom learning via bridge courses and remedial programmes. The Centre also said that states and Union territories could do away with the clause of parental consent (for a student to attend school).A senior official in the Delhi directorate of education, however, said parental consent is, for the time being, still mandatory in Delhi to attend in-person classes.Sudha Acharya, chairperson of the National Progressive School Conference (NPSC) that has over 120 Delhi schools as members, including Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, Bal Bharati Public School, Springdales School, Sanskriti School, and Delhi Public Schools, among others, said schools were looking forward to the resumption of offline classes after a prolonged closure.\u201cWe are relieved that schools will be reopening on Monday after a long time. Students are also elated with the announcement. We have started working on a timetable and hope to have everything in place before Monday,\u201d said Acharya, principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka.\u201cWhen we had reopened last time, we noticed that there was a huge learning gap. Students were struggling with writing and did not freely participate in discussions. Our priority will be to go over the syllabus and ensure that students are able to overcome any challenges that they may have faced during remote classes,\u201d said Acharya.Schools in Delhi reopened for students of all grades on November 1 last year.Barely two weeks after reopening, offline classes were suspended on November 13, owing to the hazardous pollution levels. Schools reopened on November 29, only to shut again four days later on December 2.While classes resumed for classes 6 and above from December 18, they were suspended again from December 29 on account of a spike in Covid-19 cases.Bharat Arora, general secretary, Action Committee of Private Unaided Schools, a consortium of private schools, said schools will reach out to parents and seek their consent for students to attend offline classes. \u201cAfter two years, it\u2019s high time that learning gets back on track. We will be seeking parent consent and motivating them to send children to school,\u201d said Arora.Educationists, however, said the prerequisite of parental consent and the continuation of hybrid learning (both online and in-person) would hinder the steps towards normal schooling.Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said, \u201cIf we want to prioritise offline learning, hybrid classes need to be phased out. Till the time a choice is offered, some parents will continue to be hesitant in sending children to school.\u201dWhile parents welcomed the decision to reopen schools, they said online classes could continue for children in junior grades since the academic session was nearing its end. Aprajita Gautam, president, Delhi Parents Association, said while the decision to reopen schools for children of classes 9 to 12 was welcome, since those children needed to prepare for board exams, classes for primary and middle grades could continue online until the beginning of the next session. Gautam also said the resumption of transport facility (school buses) would be crucial in getting children to return to school."}

According to the data released by that country's task force, as many as 1,028 deaths were reported in Russia in the past 24 hours. This is the highest death toll in Russia since the start of the deadly pandemic in March 2020.According to a PTI report, Putin said that he backed the Cabinet's decision to introduce a non-working period from October 30 and extending through the following week, when four of seven days already are state holidays. In areas, where the number of cases is higher, the implementation may even begin from Saturday.Russia's COVID-19 numbers have been on the rise over the past few days. Over the weekend, the daily death toll touched 1000 for the first time. According to reports, 32 per cent of the 145 million Russians have been fully vaccinated against the deadly disease. Of the 85 regions in the Eurasian country, many have restricted large-scale gatherings and have made vaccinations compulsory for public servants as well as those above the age of 60.In light of the worrying situation in the capital,\u00a0Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, on Tuesday, asked unvaccinated people above the age of 60 to remain home.

{"text": "New Delhi: Officials from INSACOG, a consortium of labs that is engaged in sequencing coronavirus variants, have said that it was being investigated whether AY.4.2 variant of COVID-19 from the Delta Plus family can spread the infection faster.The investigations carried out so far have found that the AY.4.2 variant hasn\u2019t led to an increase in the case ratio in the country.Apart from the AY.4.2 variant, AY.33 variant is also circulating in the country and AY.4.1 is also present.Sources quoted INSACOG officials as saying that the COVID-19 clusters haven't seen a jump in the country yet due to the AY.4.2 variant. They said the variant is being monitored for the last four months and nothing problematic has emerged so far.Scientists have estimated that AY.4.2, a sub-variant of the COVID-19 Delta strain that was responsible for the deadly second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in India earlier this year, could be up to 15 per cent more transmissible than the original Delta strain.The United Kingdom has been monitoring and assessing the new mutation of the Delta variant. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has already dubbed the AY.4.2 variant as a Variant Under Investigation (VUI) amid concerns that it causes increased growth rate of the virus.The concerns over the variant have been referred to by the experts to warn that the COVID-19 pandemic is not over yet.AY.4.2 variant has been dubbed as \u2018Delta Plus\u2019 and has now been named VUI-21OCT-01 by the UKHSA.While there is evidence that the AY.4.2 variant spreads more quickly than the original Delta variant, there is no evidence yet to say the new VUI causes more severe disease or renders the vaccines less effective.\"The Delta variant sub-lineage known as Delta AY.4.2 was designated a Variant Under Investigation by the UK Health Security Agency on 20 October 2021 and has been given the official name VUI-21OCT-01,\" the UKHSA said.\u201cThe designation was made on the basis that this sub-lineage has become increasingly common in the UK in recent months, and there is some early evidence that it may have an increased growth rate in the UK compared to Delta. More evidence is needed to know whether this is due to changes in the virus' behaviour or to epidemiological conditions,\u201d it added.UK media reports said the AY.4.2 variant was the cause of almost 10 per cent of all COVID-19 cases in England in the fortnight ending October 9.The scientists at the Wellcome Sanger Institute said the variant was responsible for around four per cent of cases in September and the same doubled to 8.9 per cent in the two weeks to October 9.AY.4.2 strain could be the most infectious sub-variant that has emerged since the start of the pandemic last year, said Professor Francois Balloux, director of the University College London Genetics Institute, as reported by the Financial Times."}

The absence of Hanuma Vihari from the Test squad was one of the talking points as the right-handed batsman wasn't even part of the India A squad before the squad announcement.A few\u00a0hours after unveiling the Test team, the BCCI\u00a0added Vihari to the India A squad for the three unofficial Test matches against South Africa A. While his absence from the Test team has drawn mixed reactions from the fans, former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has said that he isn't surprised with it.Speaking to Sports Today, the ICC Hall of Famer said that lack of game time could be the reason behind his non-inclusion.\u00a0\u201cI really was not surprised to be honest because he hasn\u2019t played any cricket in the interim. He hasn\u2019t played in the IPL so hasn\u2019t had any cricket under his belt in the last three or four months. On the other hand, the others who have been selected have had some cricket, not necessarily Test cricket, so maybe that\u2019s the reason why they came into the picture,\u201d Gavaskar told Sports Today.\u201cAlso, a lot of times we have seen over the years that the performances in the IPL have invariably been the ones that nudge the selection committee so that seems to have happened. Hanuma Vihari hasn\u2019t played a single IPL game so out of sight, out of mind.\"Vihari had remained a regular member of the Test\u00a0squad since his debut in 2018. He made his comeback after injury for the UK tour and was also in the 15-member squad for the World Test Test Championship\u00a0final. He didn't get a game on the UK tour.\u00a0Vihari has been replaced by Shreyas Iyer, who is uncapped in this format.The India-NZ Test series kicks off on November 25 with Kanpur hosting the opening game.

Besides Agarwal, New Zealand spinner Ajaz Patel and Australian pacer Mitchell Starc were also short-listed for the award.With regular openers Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill and KL Rahul all missing games at some point last month, Agarwal grabbed the opportunity with both hands against New Zealand and South Africa. In two matches, he scored 276 runs at an average of 69.00, which included two fifties and a century.Agarwal was the architect of the win in Mumbai against New Zealand with a Player of the Match-winning performance of 150 and 62 in the two innings. He also played a crucial role in India breaking the Centurion hoodoo for the very first time.Batting first in overcast conditions, KL Rahul and Agarwal set the platform with a brilliant opening partnership of 117. During the stand, he was tested by the fiery Proteas pace attack but came out shining with a brilliant 60. India posted 327 in the first innings, which eventually proved to be the difference between the two sides.India-born kiwi spinner Ajaz Patel's name was immortalised in cricketing history in December, when he picked up 10 wickets in an innings against India, becoming the third player in Tests to achieve the feat after Jim Laker and Anil Kumble. The left-arm spinner played just one Test in the month, where he picked up 14 wickets at an average of 16.07. He picked up all 10 wickets in the first innings but was disappointed by the Kiwi batters who were bundled out for 62.In the second innings, he picked up four wickets, including that of Agarwal and Cheteshwar Pujara. He finished with figures of 14/225, the best bowling figures in a Test match in 2021.\r\nStarc also had standout performances both with the bat and ball in hand as Australia retained the Ashes with two games to spare.In three games last month, he picked up 14 wickets at an average of 19.64 and was more than handy with the bat, scoring 117 runs at an average of 58.50. He set the tone for the whole series by dismissing Rory Burns with the first ball of the first Test. While batting, he kept Travis Head company with an innings of 35 and added 85 crucial runs for the eighth wicket.In the second Test in Adelaide, Starc snapped six wickets and scored 58. This included a brilliant four-wicket haul in the first innings that helped reduce England to 236, giving Australia a massive lead of 237 runs.In the Boxing Day Test, Starc picked two crucial wickets in the first innings, including that of England's captain Joe Root. His innings of 24 not out helped Australia gain an 82-run lead, which proved to be enough as England were bundled out for 68. He picked up three wickets in the second innings as Australia won by an innings to retain the urn."}

{"text": "South actress Nayanthara is living the time of her life with her beau Vignesh Shivan today. They are one of the most loved couples, but for the South actress the path of love life was never a cakewalk. Nayanthara was reportedly in a relationship with dancer and filmmaker Prabhudeva a decade ago. Although everything was kept super tight and secretive,until the link-up rumour started to make rounds in full swings. Every fan would talk about these alleged dating rumours about the two.When\u00a0the dating rumors were picking up pace, Parbhudeva had himself gone on record to say that Nayanthara is \"special\" and that \"he would love to marry her\". At this time, Prabhudeva was already married to his then-wife Latha and was a father of two children.This extramarital news obviously did not go down well with Prabhudva's then-wife Latha. When she found out about the same she dragged the matter\u00a0to court by reportedly alleging that Prabudeva is not supporting the family financially because of his \"extra-marital affair with Nayanthara\".Things got even nastier and both had to taste the bitter fruit of separation soon after. The married couple decided to end their 16 years of marriage in July 2010. Many fans assumed that Prabhudeva might marry Nayanthara after getting a divorce. But sadly their relationship could not stand true to the test of time an everything went down the hill within a year of living together the duo called it a quits.During an interview with The Time Of India in 2017, Nayanthara had openly spoken about the bad breakup and how she tried to move on from the difficult phase of her life. She maintained a silence over the reason but admitted that her \"life was shattered\" post the split.The actress was quoted as saying, \"To get into a break-up for anyone is the most difficult phase in their life. When you have to go away from someone you love or vice-versa, whatever the reason, it really shatters your life. But how you deal with it is important. I can't get into how I dealt with it but I have to if I want to move on and live my life.\"Nayanthara even altered the Prabhudeva tattoo inked on her forearm to 'positivity' in 2020. Well, Nayanthara is at a better place now professionally and personally!"}

{"text": "What you eat is what ultimately affects your health. This is why doctors, dietitians and health experts suggest you to be mindful of what you put on your plate, especially right now in the pandemic, when health and well-being have assumed so much of importance.Not just in India, but around the world, sattvic food has gained immense popularity. Radhika Iyer Talati, the founder of Food by Anahata, an entrepreneur, yogini, mountaineer and philanthropist, explains that the sattvic diet in Ayurveda believes in the balance of three gunas \u2014 tamas, rajas and sattva \u2014 which are important in order to lead a healthy life.\u201cFoods, therefore, are also divided into these three groups namely sattvic, rajasik and tamasik foods that, when consumed consciously, can enhance the energies of the mind, body and spirit,\u201d she says.Talati explains that sattvic foods are known to uplift purity, boost health, harmony and well-being in the body. This diet comprises \u201cpure unprocessed food that is light in potency and rich in pranic energy\u201d.\u201cSattvic diet is high-fibre, low-fat, vegetarian and completely balanced. Cooked food, consumed within three to four hours of preparation, is also considered sattvic. Whole grains such as rice, wheat, oats, millets, legumes, lentils and pulses, milk, seasonal vegetables and fruits, ghee, honey, jaggery are all examples.\u201dPlan a simple balanced sattvic meal by following these three principles:1. Eat according to your prakritiConsult a good Ayurvedic doctor to determine your prakriti. There are certain foods one must or must not consume depending on their inherent nature. Once you can identify yours, it makes it simple to know the correct type of food combination for you.2. Eat according to the seasonAyurveda teaches us that our bodies coexist with nature and our health and well-being depend on how connected we are to this biome. Ritucharya or eating according to the discipline of seasons, is an important aspect of living a healthy life. It consists of an Ayurvedic lifestyle diet routine that helps the body to cope with the seasonal impact caused on the body and mind.3. Eating that which is locally grown and cooked traditionallyOne of the most important steps to move into a sattvic lifestyle is to ensure that you get in touch with your base. Where do you come from? What is your genetic code? What is it that generations before you in your family were eating? While it is important to taste and experience everything that the modern gastronomical world is offering you, it is equally important to balance every meal with a required amount of dietary fibre, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, protein and healthy fats.Talati says that \u2018rajasik foods\u2019 elevate stress and anger, induce activity and aggravate restlessness. Caffeinated drinks such as chai, coffee, colas, chocolates, spicy food, eggs, and pungent foods come in this category.\u2018Tamasik foods\u2019, she says, make the body feel dull and lazy. It includes processed foods, preservative filled foods, meat, fish, eggs, onions, garlic, mushrooms, alcohol and stale food. Ayurveda states that any food that has remained uneaten for more than three hours becomes tamasik."}

{"text": "EXPRESSING DISPLEASURE at the unfilled vacancies in various tribunals, the Supreme Court on Wednesday took exception to the Centre\u2019s stand that it \u201chas the power not to accept the recommendations made\u201d by the Search-cum-Selection Committee (SCSC), comprising judges of the top court, for appointments.The court also expressed displeasure at the manner in which appointments were made, saying that \u201cthere cannot be any cherry-picking\u201d of names.\u201cWe are in a democratic country, following the rule of law. It is under the Constitution that we are working. You cannot say that,\u201d Chief Justice of India N V Ramana told Attorney General K K Venugopal, who sought to submit that the Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021, enables the government to take a decision on the recommendations.Hearing the matter on September 6, the court, while expressing its anguish over the delay in appointments, had given the government one week to fill the posts.In an affidavit filed thereafter, the Centre said it had made 84 appointments to tribunals since 2020, including 38 recently \u2014 18 to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT); 1 to the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT); 13 to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT); and 6 to the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT). The government said no name recommended by the SCSC was pending with it.But the bench, also comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao, questioned the government for making appointments from the waitlist.\u201cI have seen that for the NCLT, the selection committee recommended nine judicial members and 10 technical members. They kept another 10 in the waitlist for additional vacancies, whenever they arise. By the appointment letters which were issued, they have selected four-five names from the waitlist and three names from the select list. As per elementary principles, we cannot ignore the selected candidates and go to the waitlist. There cannot be any cherry-picking. I don\u2019t know what type of selection is this, what type of appointment is this,\u201d observed the CJI.\u201cEvery time, this happens. This is nothing new. Even after the order is passed, they are notifying like this. Same way, the ITAT members are also affected. Every time, the same story,\u201d the CJI said.The AG referred to Section 3(7) of the Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021, which says that the committee shall recommend a panel of two names for appointment to the post of chairperson or member, as the case may be, and the central government shall take a decision on the recommendations, preferably within three months.Justice Chandrachud responded that the provision is identical to what was there in the earlier law on tribunals \u2014 Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021, some of whose provisions were held unconstitutional by the court in July this year.The AG said the provision has three parts. First, it provides for a panel of two names, which the court has struck down. Then, it says the government will decide on the recommendations \u201cpreferably within three months\u201d, which has been struck down too, but the part that the central government shall take a decision on the recommendation made by the committee has not been struck down.\u201cEven after the selections were conducted and recommendations were made, you don\u2019t appoint them, when you pick people from the waitlist which was prepared for the purpose of being used in the future? That has nothing to do with Section 3(7),\u201d said Justice Rao.The AG submitted that \u201cthe government has the power not to accept the recommendations made. Your Lordships would know even as regards the High Courts and High Court judges\u2026\u201dWhile the CJI took exception, the AG continued: \u201cThis has been held so even in the case of UPSC where the government is entitled not to accept certain recommendations. Your Lordships\u2019 judgment says so. We have acted on that judgment\u201d.He said the government had proceeded to the waitlist only after exhausting the main list.Justice Rao recalled that a selection committee had made recommendations for the TDSAT a year-and-a-half back, but no decision had been taken till now. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long you can continue with this\u2026 What is the sanctity of the recommendations of the selection committee if the government chooses to do anything at the last stage? The persons who are conducting the interview are ultimately not heard in the appointments,\u201d he said.\u201cI think we are very unhappy with the way the issues are going on and how the decisions are taken. I want to tell you one thing \u2014 I am also one of the persons who was part of the selection committee for NCLT. We interviewed 534 candidates for judicial posts and 425 for technical posts. Out of that, 11 judicial members and 10 technical members were selected\u2026 Of these 11 selected judicial members, they selected only four. They went to the waitlist and chose three\u2026 Same with the technical members also\u2026 This is a waste of time for us then,\u201d said the CJI.He said some of those appointed were already 64 years old, and had been given tenure until 65 years. \u201cThey will get only one year of tenure. Mr AG, would you want to join the job for one year,\u201d he said.Justice Chandrachud said he was part of the selection committee for the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) and \u201cthere also the list was truncated and only a few people have been appointed.\u201dThe AG said some of the people recommended had been absorbed in other jobs at the high courts. Seeking more time, he said the government was ready to reconsider all the names which were not accepted, and \u201cin the reconsideration, we would appoint a very large number\u201d, except those facing corruption charges.\u201cWhatever problems we may have, appointment of members is the only solution,\u201d said the CJI, and asked the AG to \u201cplease tell the government (that) you have to make the appointments\u201d.The bench granted the government two more weeks to complete the appointments, and also said that it should explain the reason if any appointment could not be made."}
{"text": "India\u2019s first-ever mosque and the oldest in the sub-continent is all set to welcome back devotees and general public after regaining its past glory and grandeur.The classic beauty and humble style of the Cheraman Juma Masjid, dating back to 629 AD, was restored after a painstaking renovation and conservation process spread over nearly 30 months under the state-run Muziris Heritage Project (MHP).Located at Kodungallur taluk in this central Kerala district, the heritage structure was recreated in tune with its original character and aesthetics, at a cost of Rs 1.14 crore, P M Noushad, Managing Director of MHP, said.Besides the renovation and conservation initiative, which started in May 2019, a two-storey Islamic Heritage Museum was also constructed in the mosque campus spending nearly Rs one crore and its internal refurbishment is going on now, he noted.After submitting the letter of completion to the government, the MHP authorities are now awaiting Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan\u2019s date to reopen the oldest mosque for visitors.\u201cIt is expected to happen any day.. We are waiting for a convenient day of the Chief Minister for the inaugural function. If the COVID-19 situation is completely under control, it may happen within the next two week,\u201d Noushad told PTI.According to Oral tradition, Cheraman Perumal, as the king, went to Arabia where he met the Prophet (PBUH) and embraced Islam in the early 7th century. From there, he had sent letters, along with Malik Ibn Dinar, as a Persian scholar who travelled to India. Dinar is believed to have built the masjid in 629 AD, five years after the king\u2019s death.Noushad said they focused more on conserving the existing portions of the old structure and recreate its appearance in the past based on the old photographs.\u201cWe demolished the additional concrete structure added to the main building in 1974. We recreated the old structure of the mosque with a tile roof as seen in the old photographs,\u201d he said.Luckily, several portions of the basic structure were found retained as such, he said, adding that such portions had been renovated and conserved.Besides the MHP\u2019s conservation effort, a multi-crore construction project is also underway at the masjid under the aegis of the mosque management. An underground prayer hall, being constructed, is envisaged to accommodate at least 2000-3000 devotees. A total of Rs 15-20 crore is expected for the same, the MD explained.\u201cIt\u2019s structural work and internal plastering is over. Flooring and beautification work is pending and expected to be completed soon,\u201d he added.The MHP, entrusted with the heritage management by the state government, had initiated discussions with the mosque committee and entered into an MoU with them for implementing the renovation and conservation initiatives.After the renovation, the MHP is now awaiting the nod to include the Cheraman Juma Masjid in the Union Ministry of Tourism\u2019s \u2018National Mission on Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Augmentation Drive (PRASAD).A proposal for a Rs 10 crore project has been submitted to the Centre in this regard, the official said adding that the construction of a facilitation centre and the rejuvenation of a pond in the mosque campus would be a reality if it is included in the PRASAD scheme.\u201cA large number of people from across the state are coming here now to have a glimpse of the renovated structure of the oldest mosque,\u201d Noushad added.The Cheraman Masjid occupies a pivotal place in the Muziris civilisation that enjoyed glory as the ancient world\u2019s greatest trading centre in the East, trading everything from spices to precious stones. The land, also known as Mahodayapuram or Muyirikkode, was the capital of the Perumals as rulers in the line of Chera kings between 9th and 12th centuries AD.In the early centuries, Kodungallur was a settlement of traders, standing as the doorway to India for varied cultures and races, thus emerging as a cradle of several civilisations.It came to an abrupt end in 1341 owing to massive floods that submerged the region, according to MHP records."}

All commercial activity comes to a halt during winter, and due to avalanches, connectivity on Srinagar-Leh highway gets blocked.The strategically important Z-Morh tunnel will ensure that Sonmarg remains connected and supplies are maintained all year round, according to officials.\u201cWe will complete the tunnel by early next year, well ahead of the scheduled target of December 2023. There are concrete work, etc, remaining,\u201d G S Kambo, executive director of the National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, told reporters here on Monday. \u201cFor the first time, there will be connectivity this winter, thanks to the escape tunnel being opened.\u201dThe main tube\u2019s connectivity was achieved last week, while the escape tunnel, built as a safeguard against calamities along the main tunnel, was cleared during summer this year.For Kashmir Valley, the permanent connectivity to Sonnarg is a first. The tunnel is being built at a cost of Rs 2,300 crore.Beyond Sonmarg, the 13.5-km Zojila tunnel, which will provide all-weather connectivity between Srinagar and Ladakh, making for a strategic asset for the Army, may also be completed ahead of its scheduled target of 2026, officials said.\u201cThere are vertical shafts in the tunnel which enable opening of many fronts, so work can take place at multiple place simultaneously, Kambo said. \u201cBesides, we are achieving very good progress \u2014 like 30-40 metre excavation and a couple of blasts and tunneling every day. Work is going on at all locations. We are hopeful of completing it before schedule.\u201dThe Rs 4,600 crore Zojila tunnel is being executed by Megha Engineering and Infra Limited, while the Z-Morh tunnel is under execution of engineering major Apco. Gadkari will also inspect the progress of the Zojila tunnel on Tuesday.The Zojila tunnel is an all-weather alternative to Zojila pass, which closes down in winter, halting all transport, including troop movement and critical Army supplies between Kashmir and Ladakh. The tunnel will solve that problem. At more than 11,000 feet, the bi-directional tunnel is the longest in Asia."}

{"text": "Balbir Punj (\u2018Misleading the past\u2019, IE, October 2) has basically opposed RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat\u2019s understanding of history \u2014 Bhagwat has been trying hard to create harmony between Hindus and Muslims. Punj does not believe in letting bygones be bygones and says that the role of Islamic invaders cannot be glossed over. I have lot of respect for Punj\u2019s scholarship but he overlooked my statement that \u201ctrue ruling elite of all religions has also been oppressing peasants, indulging in plundering and at times for just political reasons destroying religious places\u201d.There are historical facts that cannot be denied but history is not unidimensional. The RSS chief was right in blaming the British because Sir Henry M. Elliot in his Bibliographical Index to the Historians of Muhammedan India (1850) deliberately presented Muslim rulers as oppressive to justify British takeover, which in his opinion, brought the so-called \u201cfull light of European truth, mildness and equity\u201d. How the British destroyed our economy and trade has been admitted even by Punj. Who can deny Dadabhai Naoroji\u2019s thesis about the \u201cdrain of wealth\u201d? Unlike the British, Muslim rulers had made India their home.Let us first talk of temple attacks \u2014 Punj has specifically mentioned Somnath. Royal temples were considered as political institutions and were an integral part of the king\u2019s sovereignty and therefore, an attack on them had political and rather than religious motivations. Chalukya king Somesyara III said it in so many words when he himself recorded that enemy\u2019s capital including palaces and temples are to be burnt. Three years prior to the Somnath attack, Chola king Rajendra I in 1022 ordered his army to travel more than 1,500 kms to defeat Pala king Mahipala. The bronze image of Siva was removed from the temple and carried to Thanjavur, the capital of the Cholas. Similarly from Odisha\u2019s Kalinga king, in addition to precious gems, idols of Bhairava, Bhairavi and Kali were forcibly taken. Several Jain temples were similarly plundered in Gujarat by the Parmara kings. King Harsha of Kashmir had institutionalised such a plundering. Indra III of Rashtrakuta dynasty had demolished the temples of the Pratiharas.The Somnath expedition was undertaken in 1025. The presiding deity here too was Siva. Mahmood Ghazni was indeed a ruthless plunderer who used to attack temples for wealth and that\u2019s why he spared thousands of temples in his 1,600 kms journey to Somnath. Considering such attacks as routine, no Sanskrit source recorded by the local people gave detailed account of highly condemnable and absolutely un-Islamic Somnath attack. Life in nearby places remained normal. Sanskrit texts did not mention religious identity of invaders but called them by their ethnic identity \u2014 Turushkas or Turks. Goa\u2019s king who visited Somnath in 1037 did not utter a word about Mahmood\u2019s attack. In 1216, temple was fortified to save it from the Hindu kings of Malwa.The RSS chief is right because it is after eight centuries or so that the British presented it as an attack on Hinduism with the clear intention to create animosity between the Hindus and Muslims. Of course, a few Persian sources glorified such shameful temple attacks. But Mahmood also appointed a Hindu military general for his army stationed at Lahore in 1033. Hindus who migrated from India and settled in Ghazni were permitted to construct their temples. Ghaznavid kings even issued coins which included Siva\u2019s bull Nandi though pictorial representation of living beings is prohibited in Islam.Moreover, ordinary Muslims were really unhappy with the temple attacks. Accordingly, when Sultan Masood, Mahmood\u2019s son and successor sent a camel loaded with wealth to a mystic saint with a letter that this wealth was acquired by his father in his Indian conquests, the saint returned it by saying he is aware of how these expeditions were made.Punj must be aware that both Mahmood and Muhammad Ghauri also attacked several Muslim kings. Ghaur\u2019s ruler Bahram Shah in 1150 burned the entire Ghazni city including the library of Ibn Sina and even destroyed mosques. True Ghauri destroyed several Hindu temples as they were considered to be the most visible signs of sovereignty of rulers. But then Ghauri also restored Prithviraj Chauhan\u2019s son to kingship of Ajmer. Similarly, after defeat in 1196, Parihara king of Gwalior and Gahadavala king of Banaras were restored as tributary kings. Solanki king in Gujarat was also restored.Timur, Nadir Shah and Ahmad Shah Abdali were certainly invaders but they fought wars against India\u2019s Muslim rulers and thus these wars were territorial not religious. Even Babur had captured Delhi by defeating Sultan Ibrahim Lodhi. Nadir Shah has called Indian Muslims as hindooane kalmago \u2014 Hindu Muslims. This is what Bhagwat has been saying all along.The political nature of temple attacks can also be understood by looking at some examples. As a prince Mohammad Bin Tughlaq in 1326 had destroyed the Siva temple at Warrangal, but after becoming sultan in 1329, he ordered repairing of Siva temple at Kalyan as the same was now in his kingdom. Even Aurangzeb supported temples with grants and money. He came down heavily on the state officials who were harassing Brahmins of Banaras. But just like Tughlaq, temples of enemies or those that gave refuge to the rebels of the state or facilitated Shivaji\u2019s escape were destroyed by him.Coming to conversion, Punj has not cited any authentic contemporary source on his claim of largescale state-sponsored forcible conversion. Nizamuddin Aulia himself had opposed conversion when a Muslim disciple brought his Hindu brother to Nizamuddin in the hope of attaining conversion. In 1317, Nizamuddin refused to even ask a Hindu to convert to Islam. In fact, Sufi saints had great respect for the Hindu religious beliefs. Nizamuddin was one day walking along the bank of the Yamuna in Delhi with Amir Khusro, they saw some Hindu women bathing in the river and offering prayers to the sun, Nizamuddin said, \u201cO, Khusro, these women are also praying to Allah. They have their own way of praying.\u201d Shahjahan in 1634 issued a formal decree about Madan Mohan temple in Brindavan and termed Hindu worship as Ibadate Ilahi (divine worship). Both Akbar and Jahangir too had opposed conversions. Thomas Coryat, a British who spent two years at Jahangir\u2019s court, says that the emperor had a dislike for the change of religion.Muslims even adopted several Hindu customs including jauhar. In 1301, Muhammad Shah, a former ethnic Mongol convert to Islam, killed his entire family when Alauddin Khalji was about to capture Ranthambhor fort. In 1617, one Qasim Khan, who had been governor of Bengal, too preferred jauhar to the capture of women.Imposition of discriminatory jazia was an exception rather than the rule and it was rarely collected except in the last decades of Aurangzeb\u2019s rule, basically to support wars in the south and to please religious fanatics. It was an exemption from the military service and was imposed on the able bodied men. Hindus who served in the imperial army were exempt. Surprisingly, tax officials once reached Nizamuddin to collect jazia.Systematic religious persecution in modern sense did not take place. Akbar banned not only killing of cows but even peacocks. No one was executed for blasphemy. When a Brahmin was sentenced to death by a kazi, the emperor became angry and sent the judge to exile in Mecca. Muslim rulers married Hindu women. Mothers of Jahangir and Shahjahan were Hindus. Syed Ali Nadeem Rizvi says Hindu and Muslim nobles used to live together with their havelis in the close proximity to Agra fort and Holi and Muharram were celebrated together. Even Hindus used to go to Muslim schools. Thus Balkrishnan Brahman during Shahjahan was sent to maktab of Abdul Majid in Hisar. Similarly Muslims used to go Hindu schools in Banaras, Thatta and Multan. Hindu and Muslim merchants used to jointly own the cargo and cargo-loaded boats in Surat and in 1666, they even jointly protested against the kazi.Punj has belittled the Hindu representation in Mughal nobility by comparing it with the recruitment of Indians by the British. But he failed to appreciate that while not many Englishmen were available in India, huge number of Muslims were at the disposal of Muslim rulers. Is it not surprising that Mughal emperor Babur in 1526 was surprised to see that all the revenue officers were Hindus in spite of 300 years of Muslim rule?Indeed, Muslim rulers did many things that by modern norms were absolutely wrong. But should we judge medieval rulers by today\u2019s standards particularly when we refuse to judge today\u2019s democratic governments by the mandate of our Constitution and its liberal and enlightened vision?The writer is Vice-Chancellor is NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad.

{"text": "Shortly after 36-year-old Shobhana Patel and her six-year-old daughter reached their apartment after participating in a garba event Sunday night, her husband Tejas surprised them with an ice-cream treat. Unaware that it was to be their last treat, Shobhana and daughter had it and went to bed.Around 1.30 am, when Tejas heard Shobhana coughing and gasping, he went to the bedroom and strangulated her before strangulating the child. He waited in the bedroom for an hour to make sure that his wife and daughter were \u201cunresponsive\u201d before calling out to his brother-in-law from the lower floor of the apartment to \u201cseek help\u201d.Vadodara police, which traced the sequence of events leading to the mysterious death of Shobhana and her daughter on October 10, arrested Tejas on Wednesday for the alleged double murder using rat poison.Lakdhirsinh Zala, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Zone IV of Vadodara city, said, \u201cOur prime suspect was Tejas\u2026 The data from his phone also showed that he had searched the internet for topics related to rat poison and its effects on humans. We recovered a used packet from the loft of their residence.\u201dPolice said that in the premeditated plan, Tejas decided to mix the rat poison with ice-cream to kill his wife and daughter. Tejas was booked for murder at Sama police station on Wednesday after autopsy reports confirmed the presence of rat poison in the bodies of the two deceased.Zala added that neighbours had told investigators that there was no rodent menace in the residential colony, adding to the suspicion on Tejas after police found a newly opened packet of the rat poison in the house.\u201cWe had begun interrogating him as a suspect while awaiting reports and also put him through forensic tests. He broke down during the interrogation and confessed to have killed his wife and daughter,\u201d Zala said.The DCP added that primary investigation also revealed that Tejas had been pursuing another woman in a one-sided relationship and wanted to plan his life ahead with her. \u201cWe are yet to investigate if the woman is aware of the crime but in his confession, Tejas described it as a one-sided affair\u2026,\u201d Zala said.Police also added that Tejas had previously threatened to kill his wife or commit suicide during a marital discord. \u201cThey especially had disagreements over his sister who did not get along with Shobhana. Tejas was living in his wife\u2019s maternal home and that was also an issue between the couple,\u201d Zala said.An investigating officer added that since the poison had taken effect on Shobhana and the child, Tejas did not have to exert much pressure while strangulating them, ensuring that the marks on Shobhana\u2019s neck were inconclusive. Tejas also said that he did not want to kill the daughter but was unsure if he would be able to \u201craise her without a mother\u201d, the officer said."}

In the Middle Kingdom, run as it is by a coterie of communists, post-pubescent \u201cacting out\u201d will no longer be considered a step in young people\u2019s journeys towards finding themselves. Their acts of rebellion \u2014 often manifested in \u201cbad behaviour\u201d \u2014 are to be seen as a failure on the part of parents, who will be punished for the misdemeanours of their offspring, according to the draft Family Education Promotion law. In essence, the state is telling young people that their individuality and agency is a myth.There is a charitable explanation for this paternalism. China, after all, is still ostensibly communist and Karl Marx did say \u201csocial being determines consciousness\u201d. Perhaps, in a conservative, authoritarian society, punishing parents for their children\u2019s misdeeds is the only way for an all-powerful state to force its way into the familial dialectic. It is more likely, though, that a task as important as raising future acolytes for the party-state is too important to be left to parents. It may take a village to raise a child, but in Xi\u2019s China, it takes the state to make a citizen.The proposed law is just the latest in a series of interventions that have seen the state countering what it appears to view as the cultural and political (which are, historically, dangerously synonymous in China) degradation of young people. In the last few months, the education ministry has limited the number of hours children can play computer and online games and the government has been urging young men to \u201cbe less feminine\u201d. Last year, it issued the \u201cProposal to Prevent the Feminisation of Male Adolescents\u201d to schools, seemingly to counter the influence of South Korean music and television in the country. Being an adolescent is hard enough.

{"text": "Written by Patrick McGeehan and Nicole Hong(A City Stirs)As New York City struggles to revive its economy from the devastation wrought by the pandemic, one key element is still missing: big-spending foreign tourists.Before the coronavirus arrived, the city was flooded with record numbers of visitors from Europe, Asia and South America. They filled hotels, restaurants, Broadway theaters and museums, spending billions of dollars and fueling a surge of jobs for local residents.Now that the federal government has decided to open the country\u2019s borders to vaccinated visitors on Nov. 8, New York City is preparing its most aggressive campaign to lure them back quickly \u2014 in time to salvage, if it can, the end-of-year holiday season.While visitors from across the United States have streamed back, the absence of foreign tourists has left a gaping hole in the city\u2019s economy because they tend to stay longer and spend more money.Although many New Yorkers are sometimes cranky about tourists, visitors have played a critical role in the city\u2019s jobs growth. The tourism industry has created an important pipeline of middle-income jobs, economists say, the vast majority of which do not require a college degree.Before the pandemic, tourists spent $47 billion annually and supported more than 280,000 jobs, according to official estimates. About half of that spending came from international visitors, although they accounted for just 20 per cent of all visitors.This year, the city\u2019s tourism agency forecasts visitor spending of about $24 billion, half of the 2019 total.The agency, NYC & Co., has lowered its forecast slightly to 34.6 million visitors this year, including just 2.8 million from outside the country. That\u2019s just over half of the record-setting totals in 2019, when there were nearly 67 million visitors, including 13.5 million from out of the country, according to tourism agency estimates.Now, the agency plans to spend $6 million on an international campaign themed \u201cIt\u2019s Time for New York City\u201d in eight countries. Already, it is switching the message on billboards in London and a few other cities from \u201cNew York City Misses You Too\u201d to \u201cNew York City Is Ready for You.\u201dFred Dixon, CEO of NYC & Co., said it would still take years to regain all of the lost tourism, but the campaign could help. \u201cThere is an enormous amount of pent-up demand, and people are anxious to travel again,\u201d he said.Many New York businesses and workers say their survival depends on the robust return of international visitors.\u201cWe\u2019re hoping the city tries to bring back these international tourists, because they\u2019re our lifeline,\u201d said Mohammed Rufai, an immigrant from Ghana who sells tickets in Times Square for a double-decker bus tour of Manhattan. \u201cWe need them.\u201dRufai, 45, said he could earn $200 a day before the pandemic, more than 70 per cent of it from sales to tourists from England, Mexico and other parts of the world. He now struggles to make half that.\u201cYou cannot ask people to ride if there are no people here to ask,\u201d he said.The lack of tourists during the pandemic ravaged the city\u2019s hotel industry, causing dozens of them to close \u2014 several permanently \u2014 and putting thousands of people out of work for more than a year.Some, like the Hilton in Midtown, the city\u2019s biggest hotel, reopened this month in anticipation of an increase in tourism spurred by the return of Broadway shows and the holiday shopping season.The performing arts and hospitality industries also suffered steep losses and rampant unemployment without the usual flocks of tourists. Hundreds of restaurants in New York City closed for good during the pandemic, and the unemployment rate in the city is still 10.2 per cent, compared with 4.8 per cent nationally.Since the Biden administration announced the lifting of restrictions, 75 per cent of new bookings at three Moxy hotels in Manhattan have come from Europe, said Mitchell Hochberg, president of Lightstone, the real estate company that operates them. Hochberg said he is considering reopening some of the restaurants and bars inside the hotels earlier than expected.\u201cThis is something we\u2019ve been waiting for,\u201d he said. \u201cNeighbourhoods like Times Square and Herald Square are suffering because a lot of people have not gone back to work, and those neighbourhoods could be activated with more tourists.\u201dBut an influx of international tourists could compound the challenges that businesses have faced with labor shortages and global supply-chain delays.Hochberg said the hotel was ready to welcome a surge in visitors, despite supply-chain issues that prompted the Moxy to switch shampoo suppliers and led to a temporary shortage of linens, towels and air-conditioning parts. The hotel, like businesses across the hospitality industry, has also struggled to fill its job openings, meaning employees may have to work longer hours this holiday season.Hotels and restaurants got a boost this fall from the reopening of Broadway theaters, which had been dark since March 2020. The Broadway League, a trade association whose members include theater owners and producers, has not released weekly sales or attendance data since then, but Charlotte St. Martin, the group\u2019s president, said that most of the 77 performances in September were sold out or close to full.During the 2018-2019 Broadway season, a record 2.8 million international visitors attended a show, accounting for 19 per cent of total attendance that year, according to the Broadway League.\u201cSince Broadway reopened, it\u2019s definitely helping,\u201d said John Fitzpatrick, who owns two hotels in Midtown. \u201cBut we need the international travelers. They come during the week, they stay longer and they have an expense account.\u201dThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."}

Why should it not happen? Delimitation will happen, elections would follow, and then statehood would also be restored.\u201dReferring to panchayats and District Development Council elections, Shah said his government had opened these opportunities for the youth. Taking a dig at the political families in the Valley, he said, \u201cWhat did 70 years of jamhooriyat (democracy) give: 87 MLAs, six MPs and three families\u2026 but Shri Narendra Modi has given 30,000 elected representatives in such a short time. Those who are making a noise are doing so because jamhooriyat has come out of the custody of three families, and it now belongs to the poor. Shri Narendra Modi brought democracy to the grassroots level.\u201dThe Union Home Minister said curfew in the Valley and a ban on internet in the aftermath of abrogation of Jammu Kashmir\u2019s special status and its bifurcation into two Union territories was done to safeguard Kashmiri lives. \u201cFor some time you suffered, but it only saved your children\u2026 when the situation normalised, we opened everything,\u201d he said.Asking the youth to set bigger targets, Home Minister Shah wanted them to use all opportunities that came their way. \u201cOne thing you should always remember.

God will definitely support you,\u201d he said.He said the situation in Jammu and Kashmir had improved after the abrogation of the special status. \u201cFrom 2014 to 2021, every year only 30 people died. Terrorism has decreased and stone pelting has ended. Nobody would be allowed to disrupt the peace in Jammu and Kashmir. We will deal with them strictly. No one would be allowed to interrupt development. It is our commitment,\u201d he said.\u201cTill now more than 4,0000 people have lost their lives. Should we end it or not? Can development coexist with terrorism?\u201d he asked. While the government can make efforts to end terrorism, it is the youth who can end it. \u201cIt is the youth who have to end terrorism, you have to do it. You have to become the ambassadors of peace and development,\u201d he said.Without naming them, Shah said he also wanted to seek an account from the three families. \u201cEarlier, students used to go to Pakistan. We have built seven new medical colleges and 11 nursing colleges. There is no need to move out of the valley. This should have happened many years ago. In 2014, there were only 500 medical seats here. Today, there are 1,150 MBBS seats\u2026 We have NIT, IIM and polytechnic colleges now. Tell us why they didn\u2019t come in 70 years.\u201dHe said Jammu and Kashmir is the first place that has administered the first dose of coronavirus vaccine to 100 percent people and the second dose to 50 per cent of its population. \u201cAs per the population, Jammu and Kashmir was given the highest oxygen plants.

{"text": "Ever heard of people consuming fat first thing in the morning? While some prefer to have soaked almonds on an empty stomach, others straightaway opt for a cup of tea or coffee to kick-start their day. But, what is considered as the best food to be had in the morning? Instead of going for a caffeinated drink, one could start their day with a portion of healthy fats, suggests nutritionist Rashi Chowdhary in an Instagram post. Rashi shared a breakfast beverage recipe with which she begins her morning routine.A post shared by Rashi Chowdhary (@rashichowdhary)According to a report published by Texas A&M University, scheduling healthy fat intake earlier in the day, during breakfast or before lunchtime, may reduce how inflamed our cells become in response to them.The study also found that the later we eat foods full of saturated fats, the more likely they are to disrupt our body\u2019s internal clock, worsening any inflammatory response. This leads to us feeling sluggish, also causing lifestyle setbacks such as going to sleep at erratic hours and feeling hungry frequently.The researchers additionally equated the effects of consuming a high-saturated fat diet later in the day with jet lag, which is a common response of fatigue and tiredness post a bout of air travel.Rashi speaks about the importance of having a relaxing set of morning rituals to help set the day on the right track. Here are the ingredients and steps to a delicious coconut matcha:*1 tbsp of clean coconut cream\n*Organic matcha powder\n*Add some hot water\n*Froth it all together (don\u2019t skip this step)\n*Add more hot water after using the frother and enjoy every sip with some good relaxing music, or read a book that empowers you while you\u2019re doing your fat first, so you can make a whole routine out of it.Do you have a set of morning ritual?

{"text": "A lot can be hidden behind a marriage. For Brad and Cyndi Marler, it was that they are both gay.A few years after their wedding, they told each other their secret. Then, for more than three decades, they told no one else.\u201cWe always said it was us against the world,\u201d Brad said.After living what they call \u201cthe all-American life\u201d in the small Illinois towns of Smithton and Freeburg, the Marlers, now both in their late 50s, decided they need to \u201clive authentically.\u201d They\u2019ve come out to their two adult children \u2014 a son and a daughter \u2014 and are navigating new lives in Chicago.While research from the UCLA School of Law Williams Institute for Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy shows that people in the U.S. are coming out at a younger age than previous generations, Brad and Cyndi are part of a segment of the LGBTQ community that waits until later in life.\u201cSociety is still inhospitable. That\u2019s not to deny so many amazing shifts in public attitudes, in laws, in policies, but it did not wash away a hundred years of homophobia in society,\u201d said Ilan Meyer, a distinguished senior scholar of public policy with the Williams Institute.Bob Mueller, 75, who grew up in suburban Chicago and now lives in Iowa, didn\u2019t breathe a word of his sexual orientation to his family until he was 40, when he wanted them to meet his partner. And he still didn\u2019t tell everyone.\u201cIt was common practice to stay in the closet if you wanted to have a job. It wasn\u2019t until 2005 that I officially came out at work,\u201d he said.Having grown up in religious households in small Illinois communities, coming out wasn\u2019t an option for the Marlers, who marked 32 years of marriage in September.\u201cBeing homosexual, you\u2019re just going to go straight to hell. There\u2019s no two ways to it,\u201d Cyndi said of what she and Brad were taught.Even as strides were made nationally for gay rights, the Marlers feared being found out. They built homes, raised their kids and never strayed from their marriage. In public, they were sure to maintain traditional gender roles: Cyndi kept her hair long, and they never mentioned that Brad was the one who decorated their house.\u201cWe wanted the house, the dog, the two kids \u2014 and we did all of that,\u201d Cyndi said.\u201cWe made a decision to make it work. This was what we were going to do,\u201d she added.But there came a limit. It was a house of cards that needed to come down, Brad said.He had become deeply depressed and began working on his internalized homophobia with the help of weekly therapy.\u201cFor such a long time, I hated that part of me. \u2026 I didn\u2019t understand why what I had with Cyndi wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d he said.The couple also says they never would have been able to come out if their parents were still alive. Brad noted that the shame he associated with his sexuality was triggered after his mother confronted him when he was 16 about the possibility of being gay. \u201cShe just said, \u2018If you are, that\u2019s not OK. You\u2019re not going to do this to the family.\u2019 \u2026 We never spoke about it again,\u201d he recalled.Another big factor was that their daughter came out as a lesbian.\u201cIt was the overwhelming need to protect her,\u201d Brad said.The Marlers lived together until March when, having retired and sold their home, they moved into separate apartments in Chicago to explore life as part of the LGBTQ community for the first time.Michael Adams, CEO of SAGE, said the nonprofit helps thousands of older Americans in their coming out journey. He says the unique obstacles they face can include higher levels of fear and anxiety, as well as managing others\u2019 expectations.Paulette Thomas-Martin, 70, came out after a 20-year marriage and when most of her children were adults.\u201cIt was very painful. \u2026 I would call them and they would not call back,\u201d she said.It took several years before her children started speaking to her again, Thomas-Martin says, but in the end it brought her family closer.\u201cMy son texted me recently telling me how proud he is of me. It came out better for my kids. I\u2019m happier. I have more joy and peace,\u201d said Thomas-Martin, who lives in New York with her wife.Adams says coming out later in life may also make socializing and dating more complicated.Brad describes it as going through a second adolescence.\u201cEverything is new,\u201d he said.Cyndi is focusing on figuring out herself before pursuing a relationship with a woman.\u201cIt\u2019s like taking this filter off and asking myself, \u2018What am I?\u2019\u201d she said.Even though the Marlers now live separately, they have no immediate plans to divorce and still see each other almost daily.\u201cWe\u2019re still best friends,\u201d Cyndi said.And despite some struggles, they believe things have improved for them.\u201cOur whole dynamic is better now,\u201d Brad said.Their daughter recently wrote her parents each a letter about the experience.\u201cShe wrote that she was happy to see that I\u2019m happy,\u201d Brad said."}
{"text": "A study published in August in the journal Cell has shed light on the evolutionary history of the rhinoceros. The rhinoceros family belongs to the Rhinocerotidae clade, which also includes the tapirs. A clade includes species from a single common ancestor.The rhinoceros family diverged from the tapir family some 55-60 million years ago. The family then evolved into over a hundred species distributed across the world, but only nine of them survived to the Late Pleistocene age (14 to 12000 years ago).The DNA of ancient and existing species of rhino has been analysed to investigate the evolutionary relationships between them\n(For subscribers)https://t.co/xbncyEsJqB pic.twitter.com/ksbFuz8goT\u2014 Nature News & Views (@NatureNV) October 20, 2021Subsequent extinctions resulted in five extant species \u2013 the black, white, Sumatran, Indian, and Javan rhinoceroses \u2013 and four extinct ones \u2013 the Siberian, Merck, narrow-nosed and woolly rhinoceroses.There are primarily three theories governing the story of rhinoceros evolution. One theory, known as the \u2018horn hypothesis\u2019, emphasises horn morphology, and puts the Sumatran, the black, and the white rhinoceros species together for they have two horns.The \u2018geographical hypothesis\u2019 clubs species according to their geographical origins; for e.g., it puts the Sumatran, Javan, and Indian species together. The third hypothesis puts Sumatran rhinoceros with the other extant species.Genomic analysesThe study assembled and examined genomes from eight rhinoceros species. The findings lend support to the geographical hypothesis and identify three major clades for the rhinoceros family.One clad comprises the black and white rhinoceros species, both from Africa. A second clade comprises Sumatran, Merck, and woolly rhinoceroses. The third clade comprises the Indian and Javan species. The paper asserts that \u201cthe principal divergence among the rhinoceros lineages is related to the geographical division between species on the African and Eurasian continents.\u201dHowever, the paper further establishes that there was gene flow between the ancestors of the African (black and white species) and the Indian-Javan species, which \u201cmay have been enabled by the Eurasian origin of both African species\u201d.Loss of genetic diversityA major finding of the study, important from the point of view of conservation efforts, is that of the loss of genetic diversity in rhinoceros populations in recent years due to rapid population declines.\u201cWe find that present-day rhinos have lower genetic diversity, and higher levels of inbreeding, compared to our historical and prehistoric rhinoceros genomes. This suggests that recent population declines caused by hunting and habitat destruction have had an impact on the genomes. This is not good, since low genetic diversity and high inbreeding may increase the risk of extinction in the present-day species,\u201d explains one of the authors, Love Dal\u00e9n, of the Centre for Paleogenetics and the Swedish Museum of Natural History, in a release.Shedding further light on the evolutionary history of the rhinoceros, vis-\u00e0-vis the history of the Earth, the paper states that the three major clades of the rhinocerotinae family diverged 17-14 million years ago, an \u2018epoch\u2019 in geologic history when the climate was 3-4 degrees Celsius warmer than it is today.The authors hypothesise that a land-\u2018bridge\u2019 connecting Afro-Arabian and Eurasian land masses formed 20 million years ago, which \u2018enabled dispersal events.\u2019 But this was followed by the creation of geographical barriers to the movement of species, a phenomenon known as vicariance or allopatric speciation.While the authors acknowledge that only a small fraction of the entire Rhinocerotinae group was studied here, they hope that genomic studies can aid the understanding of the rhino genetic history and augment efforts in population recovery.\u2013 The author is a freelance science communicator.

{"text": "Clad in elaborate priestly garments, volunteer models strode down the runway to organ music in the Cathedral of the Belgian city of Tournai,The unusual show on Wednesday organised by the cathedral, is part of an effort to promote its collection of religious textiles it says are Belgium\u2019s richest.It featured around 30 garments including liturgical capes known as chasubles embroidered with gold and silver thread.This was the first time in 50 years the garments were shown to the public, cathedral historian Michel-Amand Jacques said. Rudy Opsomer, the president of the Friends of the Tournai Cathedral, said the garments were usually kept in the church\u2019s chambers, far from the public eye.\u201dIt was a shame that they were no longer visible to the general public,\u201d Opsomer said.\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to see things beyond the religious side of these clothes.\u201dDuring the show, models presented the garments, which showed the evolution of priestly attire from the 17th to the 21st century, to an audience of around 100 people. Ornaments dating back to the 15th century that are stored at the cathedral were too fragile to be shown.Opsomer said that since the clothes are considered sacred, they could not be donned by people other than religious officials.Church tradition obliges cathedral staff to burn the garments once they are worn out.So, he said they were lucky to have the permission of Tournai\u2019s Bishop Guy Harpigny to hold the show.The way priests dress has evolved through time, Jacques said, with the more detailed and extravagant garments worn in the Baroque period being replaced by simpler ones that follow guidelines set by the Second Vatican Council in 1965.In the 18th century, Jacques said, a set of priest\u2019s clothes cost 15,000 to 18,000 French livres, which today amounts to around 250,000 to 300,000 euros ($286,000 to $343,000) \u2013 the same price as a medium-sized church at that time.\u201dTimes have changed, the church has changed,\u201d Jacques said.\u201cWe have to put ourselves in the shoes of people at that time, in the 17th or 18th century, when these ornaments were an offering to God.\u201dHarpigny, who attended the show, said the event was not a way for the church to brag about its past riches, but rather to show how the institution accompanies cultural and artistic movements throughout time.\u201dThe fact that we\u2019re showing the national heritage of the church to society is a wonderful thing,\u201d he said."}

After Sooryavanshi brought back the audience to the theatres, the trade is quite positive about the return of cinema halls after almost two years. In the first 12 days, Sooryvanshi earned Rs 159.65 crore. Bunty Aur Babli 2\u2019s box office collection might affect the upcoming releases.Nevertheless, there\u2019s a certain magic around Saif and Rani that has persisted since their Hum Tum days, which is expected to pull the audience to the theatres to watch the film.\u00a0 The first film, starring Abhishek and Rani, saw the two cons running helter-skelter, while DCP Dashrath (played by Amitabh Bachchan) chased them. It became a hit for its rollercoaster story, choice of songs, as well as the chemistry between the leads.Trade analyst and producer Girish Johar is sure that the second film would have a \u2018decent\u2019 opening weekend, despite the pandemic. \u201cWe are slowly limping back to normalcy, coming out of the pandemic, with the vaccination going in higher and the norms are being relaxed. Having seen that and the previous films (BellBottom, Sooryavanshi) also doing sufficiently well at the box office, I believe that the chance of Bunty Aur Babli 2 to do well is pretty much high at the box office. It all depends on the content, and how it is received, the reviews and feedback. Having said that, the trailer has generated much curiosity, and the first Bunty Aur Babli did pretty well.\u201dWill Abhishek Bachchan\u2019s absence reduce the footfall? \u201cSaif Ali Khan is a very good actor and has a lot of fan following, and they are introducing two new characters and the trailer has also been well-received. I am expecting a decent start at the box office,\u201d he says.However, Johar notes that there are still state-level restrictions, owing to the pandemic. \u201cSome cinemas are still not functioning at full capacity. Despite that, it is a very upmarket film targeting the youth as well as grade A cities of the country, Delhi, Bombay, Hyderabad\u2014the top metro cities. The screens are not decided, so we still need to make a guess. The capacities are not at their optimum level and are not at the earlier level. It will be a double shot in the dark (to make a guess).

He\u2019s not even in his costume. He\u2019s with his family in New York, and it has this Christmas spirit to it.

Look, don\u2019t get me wrong, there\u2019s a lot of action. There\u2019s a lot of amazing things and tonnes of surprises. But it only matters if you care about the people.

{"text": "Last Thursday, a Gandhinagar sessions court granted bail to 55 Gujarat Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders and activists after they had been lodged in Sabarmati Central Prison for 11 days for holding a protest outside the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)\u2019s state headquarters in Gandhinagar.As many as 93 AAP members, including 10 college students and 28 women activists, were arrested and put in the Ahmedabad-based jail on 20 December for protesting outside the BJP office against the alleged leak of a question paper in the Gujarat clerical staff recruitment examination.The arrested AAP members included virtually all the senior leaders of the party\u2019s Gujarat unit, including its state president Gopal Italia. They were booked on various charges under 22 IPC sections, including criminal conspiracy, and sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.This was the first time in Gujarat in decades that the entire top brass of a political party was arrested on such stringent charges and jailed for holding a protest. The eight-year-old AAP, however, succeeded in making an impact by raking up the question paper leak scandal: the Gujarat police was forced to lodge an FIR and make arrests in the case following which the state government cancelled the exam.For the past several years now, the AAP has been making attempts to make inroads in Gujarat politics dominated by the BJP and the Opposition Congress party. The AAP had contested the state\u2019s all 26 Lok Sabha constituencies in the 2014 general elections, but lost everywhere. It contested 29 of the total 182 seats in the 2017 Assembly polls, but lost its deposits in all of them.Stepping up attempts to make its mark in Gujarat, the AAP appointed the 32-year-old firebrand activist Gopal Italia as its state unit chief in 2020. A former police constable, Italia had hit the headlines in March 2017 when he threw a shoe at then state home minister Pradipsinh Jadeja alleging the government\u2019s failure in enforcing prohibition.While expanding its organisational base in the state, the AAP subsequently inducted a slew of prominent faces from different fields, including popular TV anchor Isudan Gadhvi, youth leader Yuvrajsinh Jadeja, farmer activist Sagar Rabari, Patidar youth leader Nikhil Savani, and noted industrialist Mahesh Savani among others.In February 2021, the AAP contested the urban local body elections across Gujarat and sprang a surprise by winning 27 seats in the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) polls. The BJP again won the SMC, even as the Congress drew a blank, thereby vacating the principal Opposition\u2019s space there for the new player.Following the AAP\u2019s SMC victory, top leaders from Delhi, including partysupremo and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia, started making frequent visits to Gujarat, sensing an opportunity to expand the party\u2019s footprint in the state. They have since declared that the AAP will contest all the seats in the state Assembly elections slated for December this year.In October 2021 election to the Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation (GMC), the AAP won only 1 seat but in the three-cornered fight the Congress lost a number of seats. The Congress, which had won 16 seats in 2015 polls, managed to win only 2 of the total 44 GMC seats due to splitting of votes against the winner BJP.\u201cThe manner in which we performed in Gandhinagar elections has made BJP nervous,\u201d claimed Sagar Rabari. \u201cInitially, they thought that AAP is here to only cut the Congress votes. However, as our vote percentage keeps rising election after election, they (BJP) are now scared\u2026 Putting our leaders in jail under stringent sections shows the BJP\u2019s fear.\u201dSeeking to reach out to youths and connect with people in urban areas of Gujarat, the AAP has been raising issues like employment, education and various scams, aiming to carve its position in the anti-BJP space with the Congress failing to dislodge the BJP from power for 25 years now.Gujarat politics has traditionally been a two-party affair, where power has oscillated between the Congress and the BJP, with the latter ruling the state continuously since 1990s.\u201cThe Congress is content with being the primary Opposition party in Gujarat. However, even the supporters of Congress know that it is only AAP that can bring some change in the system. Therefore they are also joining us in large numbers,\u201d Rabari said.The Gujarat BJP, however, dismisses that it may face any challenge from the AAP in the \u201cnear future\u201d. A senior BJP said, \u201cWe do not see them (AAP) as a potent political opponent in the next Assembly elections. We consider them as a motley group of destructive elements who have no positive agenda. Since 2013-14, barring a couple of names, no reputed person has joined the AAP party in Gujarat. And whoever are there in the AAP Gujarat, they do not have cohesiveness.\u201dOn the registration of stringent criminal charges against the AAP leaders for protesting outside the ruling party\u2019s headquarters, the BJP leader said, \u201cWhatever happened, has happened in haste. And so, if you notice, our party has gone silent on the issue after initial registration of FIR. Someone at the top in our (BJP) party has realised that they (AAP) want publicity and we are going to deny them the same.\u201d"}

Inaugurating the plenary session of the state Congress (I), the prime minister said it was dangerous when a party used administrative machinery to strengthen itself. The Congress never resorted to this practice. She said that Kerala would not have been in an economic crisis had the Marxists not used the power for furthering their political end. She said her party was subjected to a continuous onslaught from both the left and the right. However, the stand of the Congress (I) was vindicated. Even the right parties had now accepted socialism and broadly supported her foreign policy. Even the Communists were following broadly Congress policies.BJP Demands ProbeThe Bharatiya Janata Party had demanded a probe by a high-level agency into the killings of people of a Scheduled Caste community in Sadhopur, Uttar Pradesh. The party has also asked the state chief minister to step down since he could not protect the people of the marginalised community. The delegation led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee had visited the village on January 1. Vajpayee said that there was strong suspicion that one of the gangs responsible for the Deoli killings was behind the massacre in Sadhopur.Curfew In TezpurTezpur town was brought under curfew on January 2 as shopkeepers in Gauhati put down their shutters and darkness descended on the city with people observing a hour-long bandh to mourn the deaths in police firing.

{"text": "The use of the expression \u201claw and order\u201d is very common and the terms \u201claw\u201d and \u201corder\u201d have been coupled for centuries. Everyone understands \u201claw\u201d. What is \u201corder\u201d? In whichever way the word is defined, typically as the opposite of disorder in society, \u201corder\u201d has a connotation of enforcement of the law. In other words, \u201corder\u201d requires the efficient functioning of the courts and police. Economists have a technical definition of \u201cpublic good\u201d. Ignoring that narrow and technical definition of public good, loosely, we understand \u201cpublic good\u201d as something that must be delivered by the government. It cannot, or should not, be delivered by the private sector. Notwithstanding the use of private security guards, most people will agree \u201claw and order\u201d is a public good. If not delivered efficiently by the government, in the real \u2014 or reel \u2014 world, the private sector may step in to fill the breach, with undesirable consequences. The expression \u201cgovernment\u201d should not be used in the singular, since there are layers in our three-tiered structure of governance. Article 246 of the Constitution mentions three lists in the Seventh Schedule \u2014 union, state and concurrent lists.The union list makes no mention of \u201corder\u201d. It only mentions: \u201cDeployment of any armed force of the Union or any other force subject to the control of the Union or any contingent or unit thereof in any State in aid of the civil power; powers, jurisdiction, privileges and liabilities of the members of such forces while on such deployment.\u201d The state list mentions \u201cpublic order\u201d and \u201cpolice (including railway and village police)\u201d.\u201cNotwithstanding anything in the two next succeeding subsections, the Federal Legislature has, and a Provincial Legislature has not, power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule to this Act.\u201d Other than those steeped in constitutional history, I don\u2019t think too many people will recognise this quote. It comes from Government of India Act, 1935 and is not a quote from the present Constitution. The present Seventh Schedule and union (at that time Federal) list, state (at that time Provincial) list and concurrent lists are inherited from that 1935 piece of legislation.Every public good is optimally delivered at a certain level of government. Delivery becomes sub-optimal both above that level and below that level. Most public goods people will think of are efficiently delivered at the local government level, not Union or state level. There is a Seventh Schedule issue that is thus linked to the insertion of a local body list. Countervailing pressure by citizens increasingly demands efficient delivery of such public goods. But without delegation of funds, functions and functionaries, presently left to the whims of state governments, local governments are unable to respond.In hindsight, it is a bit surprising that Constituent Assembly debates (in 1949) on Article 246 (at that time Article 217 in the Draft) were so perfunctory. B Das (former chief minister of Odisha) did raise the issue. \u201cThere are, Sir, 91 items in List I alone. There are of course some honourable members who have given notice of amendments with particular items. But if there is a general discussion concerning the principles involved in the Union, Concurrent and State lists, it will considerably clarify the position and will help us to understand the lists much better.\u201d Rajendra Prasad, who was chairing the debate, didn\u2019t agree and the discussion was limited to the items included.The point was raised again in 1971 by the Rajamannar Committee \u2014 formally known as Centre-State Relations Inquiry Committee \u2014 set up by Tamil Nadu. \u201cThe Committee is of the opinion that it is desirable to constitute a High Power Commission, consisting of eminent lawyers and jurists and elderly statesmen with administrative experience to examine the entries of Lists I and III in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and suggest redistribution of the entries,\u201d it noted. Why should one take the Seventh Schedule as given, simply because the Government of India Act of 1935 gave us those principles? One shouldn\u2019t convey the impression that today\u2019s Seventh Schedule is identical to the one in 1950. Items have moved from the state list to the concurrent list and from the concurrent list to the union list. Hitherto, such limited movements have reflected greater centralisation, such as in 1976. But scrutiny on the basis of first principles need not always lead to greater centralisation. The Rajamannar Committee was set up by a state\ngovernment.Take police, which is squarely in the state list. We know that the states have been lackadaisical in implementing the 2006 Supreme Court ruling in the Prakash Singh case. In the quote from the union list, there is a reference to \u201cCentral Armed Police Forces\u201d and there are seven of these. That perfunctory implementation may be the reason why states frequently ask for Central police forces to enforce law and order. This is similar to state highways being converted to national highways, so that they are taken care of better. A couple of years ago, on the basis of first principles, the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy brought out a report on how the Seventh Schedule might be cleaned up. N K Singh, Chairman of 15th Finance Commission has also often made this point, in addition to scrutiny of Article 282. The 1983 Sarkaria Commission and the 2002 National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution ducked the issue. For the sake of better governance, it\u2019s not an issue that should be ducked and the basic structure doctrine doesn\u2019t stand in the way.The writer is chairman, Economic Advisory Council to the PM.

{"text": "Written by Natasha FrostTwo days after a colossal volcanic eruption spawned a tsunami that struck the island nation of Tonga, severed communication lines left Tongans around the world waiting anxiously for news of their loved ones, while aid agencies and the country\u2019s Pacific neighbours struggled to assess the scale of the damage.On Saturday night, an undersea volcano about 40 miles north of Tonga\u2019s main island belched ash, gas and steam more than 12 miles into the air, creating a cloud of sulfur dioxide over the region, sending particles drifting across the island and disabling a crucial submarine internet cable. It was believed to be the largest volcanic eruption in three decades, with the shock wave travelling thousands of miles.Hours later, Tonga, a country of around 1,00,000 people, was pummeled by a tsunami. Waves of up to 4 feet hit Nuku\u2019alofa, the Tongan capital. Footage shared in the final moments before the internet connection was cut showed people running inland, searching desperately for higher ground in a very flat country.The volcano, Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha\u2019apai, erupted again on Monday but did not trigger a tsunami warning. Tonga sits along the Pacific \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a series of fault lines where earthquakes and volcanic activity are frequent.Fatafehi Fakafanua, the speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Tonga, was able to send out a message on social media on Monday, describing the tsunami\u2019s effect as \u201cdevastating\u201d and noting that the fall of volcanic ash had affected many areas of the country.\u201cThe full extent of the harm to lives and property is currently unknown,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we do know is that Tonga needs immediate assistance to provide its citizens with fresh drinking water and food.\u201d\ufeffThe loss of most communications, as well as a lingering ash cloud that had reached some 63,000 feet high, have made it difficult for the outside world to get a picture of the situation in Tonga.Both Australia and New Zealand sent surveillance flights to the country Monday. The United Nations said its agencies were standing by to send emergency supplies to Tonga but were awaiting information about what was needed.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a clear picture,\u201d St\u00e9phane Dujarric, a UN spokesperson, told reporters in New York. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has a clear picture. And that\u2019s what everybody, I think, is, first of all, scrambling to get exactly: the clarity of information so we can dispatch the right kind of aid.\u201dDujarric said that the UN had 23 staff members in Tonga \u2014 all but one of them Tongans \u2014 and that \u201call were accounted for,\u201d correcting his earlier statement that no UN workers were in the country. The organisation\u2019s offices for the region are in Fiji, which is about 500 miles to the northwest.Based on information gathered by the Australian surveillance flight, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported significant infrastructure damage on Tongatapu, the main island, particularly to property in the western beaches region.There was \u201cparticular concern\u201d about two small low-lying islands from which there had been no contact and on which just more than 100 people live. \u201cAn active distress beacon had been detected from Mango,\u201d the report said, referring to one of the islands.The information vacuum left thousands of overseas Tongans to make do with piecemeal videos \u2014 of waves buffeting the shore, or of families sheltering under tables below a dark sky \u2014 that were shared through the island\u2019s few satellite links.The organisations with access to these communications, including the New Zealand High Commission, have filled in some of the blanks, although many people were still waiting desperately for news.Siniva Valu Filise, who lives in Wales, where her husband played professional rugby, is worried about her parents, 73 and 66, whose home is on the western side of Tonga.A friend with a connection to the Tongan military was able to briefly confirm in a message that her parents were safe, she said. But she is unsure about their access to clean drinking water and food after the eruption left the layer of ash across the country.\u201cWe feel so helpless,\u201d she said. \u201cJust watching from afar, we can\u2019t even do anything.\u201dShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s been two days now. It\u2019s just so hard, trying to hold on to that glimmer of hope.\u201dTwo people have been reported missing, according to the UN, and at least one person died in the tsunami. Angela Glover, a British woman who had lived in Tonga for about five years, was swept away while trying to save her dogs, according to video footage. Her husband, James, survived by holding on to a tree.On Monday, the day before Glover\u2019s body was found, Fatima Dowling, a friend of the couple\u2019s who lives in New South Wales in Australia, said it was becoming harder to remain optimistic. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of \u2014 the longer it drags on,\u201d she said, her voice trailing off. \u201cIt\u2019s not a very big island. If she hasn\u2019t been found yet. \u2026\u201dDowling, who had volunteered with Glover in Tonga, was also waiting for news from a different friend who runs a resort, with whom she normally speaks daily. \u201cI pretty much ring her every hour or so, but nothing\u2019s happening,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just impossible at the moment.\u201dTongans overseas have organised prayer circles and vigils to support one another as they await word.\u201cI\u2019ve just been talking to friends, organising prayer vigils and stuff like that for family and for Tongans overseas who are trying to make connections with family back home,\u201d said Mele Makelesi Facci, who lives in Melbourne, Australia, and has not heard from her relatives in Tonga, including a niece who had a baby a few weeks ago.For Tongan seasonal workers living in Australia, such community and prayer were helping to bridge the gap, she added.\u201cThey feel helpless. They can\u2019t do anything from here,\u201d she said. \u201cJust not being able to be connected, I think it\u2019s the hardest part.\u201d"}

{"text": "Cameroon authorities have blamed a deadly stadium crush at the African Cup of Nations tournament on a \u201cmassive\u201d influx of ticketless fans who arrived late to a game involving the host team and tried to force their way in to avoid security checks and COVID-19 screening.In response, the government ordered 250 extra police officers for Cameroon\u2019s next game, a quarterfinal against Gambia on Saturday at a different stadium.The stampede at Monday\u2019s Cameroon-Comoros last 16 match at the African Cup\u2019s main Olembe Stadium in the capital of Yaounde left eight people dead and another 38 injured, seven of them seriously. It was one of the worst stadium disasters in the history of Africa\u2019s biggest soccer tournament.Cameroon Sports Minister Narcisse Mouelle Kombi said at a news conference on Friday that the full results of a government investigation were not yet available, but he did reveal some new information.Close to 60,000 fans tried to get into the game at the Olembe, Kombi said, when the crowd was meant to be capped at a maximum of 48,000 people because of COVID-19 restrictions.African Cup organizers have made it compulsory for fans to present negative virus tests and proof they are vaccinated against COVID-19 to attend games.But many fans didn\u2019t have tickets or meet the COVID-19 screening criteria and so forced their way in, Kombi said. Local TV stations have broadcast footage of fans climbing over security fences at the time of the crush.\u201cI will not be able to give you the results of investigations ordered by Cameroon President Paul Biya but the massive and late influx of supporters and spectators at Yaounde\u2019s Olembe stadium caused the crush,\u201d Kombi said.Also, the fans had arrived late because they had been watching an earlier match on TV, Kombi said.Authorities haven\u2019t yet explained why security officials directed fans toward a gate that was locked, as witnesses have claimed and which contributed to the crush. Or why security was so inadequate and so easily overwhelmed.Kombi is also the president of Cameroon\u2019s local organizing committee for the tournament.He said the increased security for Cameroon\u2019s game against Gambia in the commercial capital Douala on Saturday was \u201cto stop the uncivil behavior of Cameroonians who want to force themselves into the stadium when they do not have entry tickets and negative COVID-19 test results.\u201dKombi said organizers would no longer allow children under the age of 11 to attend games after a number of children were caught up in the crush at the Olembe.The Confederation of African Football, which runs the African Cup alongside local organizers, has taken one of the quarterfinals away from the Olembe Stadium as a result of the crush. CAF president Patrice Motsepe said the Olembe also will not host a semifinal and the final on Feb. 6 unless Cameroon soccer officials can guarantee the games will be safe.The extra police presence at the Japoma Stadium in Douala for Saturday\u2019s game was also in response to an incident at that stadium during a group game between Algeria and Ivory Coast, when around 40 fans invaded the field at the end of the match. Some of the fans grabbed hold of players and had to be dragged away.Cameroon police chief Martin Mbarga Nguelle said he has personally overseen the security preparations for Cameroon\u2019s quarterfinal.The Central African nation of Cameroon was meant to host the African Cup in 2019 but was stripped of that year\u2019s event by CAF because of problems with its stadium preparations. CAF warned Cameroon as recently as a few months ago that the facilities and security plans at the Olembe were inadequate and threatened to take the opening game away from the 60,000-seat arena, which cost Cameroon over $300 million to build for the African Cup."}

{"text": "As an actor, Asif Ali has come a long way since his debut movie Ritu, directed by Shymaprasad, in 2009. He came into the industry without a godfather or any privileges and made a name for himself in the industry slowly but steadily over the years. Though many of his initial movies were flops, he made his presence felt in some of the most successful multi-starrers like Traffic, Bachelor Party, Sevens among others. The actor, however, got typecast by playing similar characters that reflected a carefree disoriented youth in movies like Honey Bee, Kili Poi, Idiots, Bicycle Thieves etc. However, Asif made the best of the opportunities he got and was part of some critically acclaimed movies over the years. On his birthday, let\u2019s revisit five most memorable roles played by this versatile actor.Sleevachan in Kettiyolaanu Ente MalakhaUndoubtedly, an irritatingly naive and shy Sleevachan, played by Asif in Nissam Basheer directorial Kettiyolaanu Ente Malakha, is one of the most convincing performances by the actor in his career. Asif played Sleevachan, an innocent village youth who\u2019s helpful and pleasant to everybody, and who takes care of his ageing mother. However, Sleevachan gets totally embarassed in front of his family and village when he physically violates his own wife without knowing the difference between rape and consensual sex. Asif portrayed the character so effectively you even feel sorry for his naivety in the end. His performance was widely appreciated for staying true to the character\u2019s roots and culture.Govind in UyareOne of the most hated characters in Malayalam cinema, Asif\u2019s portrayal of Govind in the Manu Ashokan directorial Uyare was widely discussed for the toxic love. Asif played the character of Govind who is seemingly an introvert but also is very possessive about his lover Pallavi played by Parvathy. His possessiveness leads to toxic traits which culminates in Govind throwing acid on Pallavi\u2019s face. Asif\u2019s Govind had a dark undertone and at times, the viewers could get a sense of his disturbed mind.Omanakuttan in Adventures of OmanakuttanAn experimental film which didn\u2019t do well at the box office, Rohith VS directorial Adventures of Omanakuttan, starring Asif Ali and Bhavana, is one of the most underrated movies of Asif. The actor effortlessly plays a shy and introverted character Omanakuttan in the movie. Omanakuttan finds excitement in chatting anonymously with random women over phone as another self of his being is awakened. Asif again proved his knack for playing characters that draw sympathy from the viewers.Abhilash in Anuraga Karikkin VellamA heartwarming film about love and separation, Anuraga Karikkin Vellam, directed by Khalid Rehman, starred Asif Ali, Rajisha Vijayan and Biju Menon in the lead roles. Asif played a typical youth named Abhilash who\u2019s not serious about anything in life and takes everything for granted. He doesn\u2019t value the love and affection he gets from his girlfriend nor does he take his profession seriously. Later in the movie, he realises the importance of both but it is too late. Asif played the character with his mannerisms, body language and dialogue delivery on point. He also proved he can handle humour and emotional scenes equally well in this movie.Sharath in OzhimuriA period drama which discussed the matrilineal system in the Nair community, Ozhimuri, directed by Madhupal, starred Lal, Asif Ali and Bhavana in the lead roles. Asif played the role of Sharath who is confused between the legal and emotional battle between his father and mother. Asif played the character with maturity, earning praise from critics and viewers alike."}

The Sovereign Green Bond, also known as a Green Gilt, is planned as giving both investors and savers across the UK the opportunity to join the \"collective fight against climate change\".\n\n\"Financial services don't just generate prosperity at home. They give us the economic power to project our values on the global stage,\" said Sunak.\n\n\"More open, more competitive, more technologically advanced, and more sustainable \u2013 that is our vision for financial services. The Roadmap we are publishing today sets out a detailed plan for the next few years \u2013 and I look forward to delivering it, together,\u201d he added.\n\nThe minister also revealed that a post-Brexit financial services deal with the European Union (EU) \"has not happened\" but that the UK has greater freedom to plan its global finance cooperation as a non-member of the economic bloc.\n\n\"Now, we are moving forward, continuing to cooperate on questions of global finance, but each as a sovereign jurisdiction with our own priorities,\u201d he said.\n\n\"We now have the freedom to do things differently and better, and we intend to use it fully\u2026 The EU will never have cause to deny the UK access because of poor regulatory standards,\" he added.\n\nIn the important speech, Sunak acknowledged the role of the financial services sector in the UK, contributing 76 billion pounds in taxes annually and employing 2.3 million people."}

{"text": "Corporate Social Responsibility spending under the companies law should not be interpreted as a source of financing the resource gaps in government schemes, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has said as it issued a detailed set of FAQs for the effective implementation of CSR norms.\n\nActivities undertaken by companies as part of the normal course of business is not considered CSR work. However, the ministry has provided an exemption for companies engaged in R&D activities for new vaccines, drugs and medical devices in their normal course of business with respect to COVID.\n\nThe exemption would be in place for three financial years till FY 2022-23, as per the FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) dated August 25.\n\n\"This exclusion is allowed only in case the companies are engaged in R&D in collaboration with organisations as mentioned in item (ix) of Schedule VII and disclose the same in their board reports,\" the ministry said.\n\nThe organisations are specified under item ix of Schedule VII, which pertains to CSR, under the Companies Act, 2013. Such organisations include public-funded universities and the Indian Institute of Technology (IITs).\n\nUnder the Act, a certain class of profitable companies are required to shell out at least two per cent of their three-year annual average net profit towards CSR activities in a financial year.\n\nNoting that the objective of CSR provisions is to involve the corporates as partners in the social development process, the ministry said the use of corporate innovations and management skills in the delivery of 'public goods' is at the core of CSR implementation by the companies.\n\n\"Therefore, CSR should not be interpreted as a source of financing the resource gaps in Government Schemes. However, the Board of the eligible company may undertake similar activities independently subject to fulfilment of Companies (CSR Policy) Rules, 2014,\" it noted.\n\nIt has also been made clear that the involvement of employees in CSR projects cannot be monetised and considered under the 'CSR expenditure' head by a company.\n\nAn international organisation cannot act as an implementing agency for CSR activities. However, a company can engage international organisations for the limited purposes of designing, monitoring, and evaluation of the CSR projects or programmes, or for capacity building of personnel of the company involved in CSR activities, the ministry noted.\n\nAmong other requirements, there is a provision for impact assessment for CSR projects done by the companies concerned and it came into effect on January 22, 2021.\n\nIt will be applicable for companies with a minimum average CSR obligation of Rs 10 crore in the immediately preceding three financial years. It will also be applicable for companies that have CSR projects with outlays of at least Rs 1 crore and which have been completed not less than one year before undertaking impact assessment.\n\nAccording to the ministry, impact assessment shall be carried out project-wise only in cases where both the above conditions are fulfilled, and in other cases, it can be taken up by the company voluntarily.\n\nProviding clarity, the ministry said expenditure incurred on impact assessment is over and above the specified administrative overheads of 5 per cent towards CSR work.\n\n\"Expenditure up to a maximum of 5 per cent of the total CSR expenditure for that financial year or 50 lakh rupees (whichever is lower) can be incurred separately for impact assessment,\" it added.\n\nAlso, the ministry said that the CSR costs of a company cannot be claimed as business expenditure.\n\nIn January, the ministry amended the CSR rules with an aim to strengthen the CSR ecosystem by improving disclosures and by simplifying compliances.\n\nAfter receiving various references and representations from stakeholders seeking clarity on various CSR-related issues, the ministry has come out with FAQs and the responses for \"better understanding and facilitating effective implementation of CSR\".\n\nCompanies having at least Rs 500 crore net worth or a minimum turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or a net profit of Rs 5 crore or more are required to comply with CSR norms.\n\nAnand Subramanian, Partner at Deloitte India, said the FAQs provide important clarifications related to various implementation questions for corporate India.\n\nThe clarifications related to eligibility of expenditure incurred on R&D activities up to fiscal 2022-23 by companies in the normal course of business for vaccines, drugs, and medical devices related to COVID in collaboration with specified organisations is a welcome step, he noted.\n\nAbout the FAQs, Suraj Nangia, Partner - Govt & Public Sector Advisory - at advisory firm Nangia Andersen said it has been elucidated that if a company spends more than the required amount on CSR, the excess amount can be set off against the mandatory CSR expenditure in the succeeding three years with effect from January 2021."}

{"text": "In an apparent dig at the Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday that those responsible for policy formulation on water conservation and providing tap water to homes for a long time were insensitive to poverty and water scarcity as they had never faced it themselves while living in residences with swimming pools.\n\nSpeaking soon after launching the Jal Jeevan Mission App and the Rashtriya Jal Jeevan Kosh, the Prime Minister said the scheme was a big movement towards decentralization as it empowered the gram panchayats and water committees to deal with the issue. The Jal Jeevan Mission was launched on August 15, 2019 and aims to bring tap water to homes.\n\n\"Friends, we have seen several movies, read stories and poems which inform at length how women and children in rural areas walk miles to get water. In the minds of some people, images of such difficulties emerge whenever you mention a village, but the question arises in very few minds as to why these people have to walk everyday to a river or a pond to get water and why water is not available at their homes,\" Modi said.\n\nThe Prime Minister said as chief minister of Gujarat, where water scarcity was a major issue, he was familiar with drought like situations and knew the importance of every drop of water. However, others in power had been insensitive.\n\n\"Those on whom the responsibility of formulating policies lay for a long time should have asked this question to themselves, but they did not do so as they had not seen such water scarcity where they lived. They did not know the pain of living with scarce water. There was ample water at home and a swimming pool with water. There was water everywhere. Such people had never seen poverty. So, poverty for them was an attraction and something to be depicted in literature and debates,\" he said.\n\nDuring his tenure as Prime Minister, more than '2.25 Lakh Crore have been given directly to gram panchayats for water and cleanliness management, the Prime Minister said. He maintained that the government is given due importance to transparency while giving powers of management and planning to the gram panchayats. The Centre is committed to gram swaraj, he added.\n\nThe Jal Jeevan Mission is women and village driven. The programme empowers girls who can now spend more time to their education as they do not have to walk miles to depends on jan bhagidari.\n\nWater connection has been provided to 1.25 lakh villages in 80 districts since the launch of this scheme.
